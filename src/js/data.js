    "content": "Instagram hashtags can help increase your reach and following on the platform. When used appropriately, your posts will get noticed by more individuals who are interested in your business or the items you sell. Recently, the company introduced the new Top posts and Recent top posts hashtag sorting algorithm on the platform. However, it looks like the recent change has not been well received by some. Multiple Instagram users ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ) are reportedly getting annoyed by the newly introduced Top posts and recent top posts hashtag sorting. This is because, after the recent change, one can only view the top mosts posts made by content creators with a decent following. Due to this, users are unable to find the most recent posts made by other users across the globe. Also, the same posts are being shown to them repeatedly, which limits their ability to find new and interesting stuff. Recent posts not loading for Locations explore search. Source Recent posts not showing up though “Top” posts can be seen. Source This is understandably a piece of bad news for all those who like to view new art or want to get images of current events as they are happening. And to add to their troubles, new content creators, or the ones with a limited following are unable to expand their reach like they earlier could. Resultantly, Instagram has now become less useful for a section of users. Some are even speculating that the company has made this move in order to force users to pay for content promotion. Having said that, we will continuously monitor this issue and update this article with the latest information.

    "content": "Intel is reportedly planning to shake up its longstanding naming conventions for consumer-focused CPUs with the upcoming launch of its Meteor Lake processors. For more than 17 years, Intel has used the ‘Core i’ name for many of its desktop and laptop CPUs. Read: Rain Mobile launches in roaming deal with Vodacom However, recent benchmark leaks suggest a possible rebranding of Intel’s CPUs, and the company’s director of communications, Bernard Fernandes, has all but confirmed the change in a tweet , stating: “Yes, we are making brand changes as we’re at an inflection point in our client roadmap in preparation for the upcoming launch of our Meteor Lake processors. We will provide more details regarding these exciting changes in the coming weeks.” Yes, we are making brand changes as we’re at an inflection point in our client roadmap in preparation for the upcoming launch of our #MeteorLake processors. We will provide more details regarding these exciting changes in the coming weeks! #Intel The Meteor Lake processors are expected to be built from multiple smaller “chiplets,” a departure from Intel’s previous approach of using a single die. This move could prove to be a smart one for Intel as it transitions to newer chip technologies. However, whether a fresh moniker will be enough to convince consumers to upgrade remains to be seen. With the economic climate and the fact that machines bought during the Covid-19 pandemic are still far from obsolete, PC sales are slow, and there is no major release of Windows on the immediate horizon to drive a PC refresh cycle. Intel plans to launch Meteor Lake in the second half of 2023, and the company may make the rebranding announcement at the annual Computex event in Taiwan at the end of May.",

    "content": "There are several points of legitimate criticism that are directed at Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Among the most persistent involves claims about an emerald mine, which critics on social media have related to Musk’s fortune and success being built on the back of “stolen jewels,” “blood diamonds,” or “apartheid,” for that matter. Considering the prevalence of the story, it was no wonder that the claim emerged on Twitter this weekend. This time around, it came in the form of a Community Note on Twitter, which responded to a user’s post stating that Musk had come to the US with no money and graduated with over $100,000 in debt, and that the CEO worked two jobs while he was at school. As per the Community Note, which has since disappeared from the post, the post was reportedly “misleading” because Musk “was born into an extremely wealthy family in South Africa.” The Community Note received polarizing reactions on Twitter, with supporters of the CEO stating that it was inaccurate and critics celebrating it. It should be noted that the Musk family’s relation to an emerald mine was referenced years ago, initially in two reports from Business Insider South Africa from 2018. The reports were based on comments from Errol Musk , Elon Musk’s father, who told the publication, among other things, that Elon and Kimbal at one time sold a pair of emeralds to Tiffany’s in New York City for about $2,000, and that the Musk family was so wealthy that they had difficulty closing their safe. Now, the idea of Tiffany’s purchasing emeralds from teenagers who walked in the store may be a bit suspect, as such practices are more commonly affiliated with traditional pawnshops, and the idea of a safe not being closed easily because of too much money inside may sound cartoony, but Business Insider South Africa ran with the story anyway. At the end of the article, however, the publication noted that Errol’s story could not be confirmed by Elon because the father and son have a complicated history. What is rather interesting here is that Musk has actually referenced an emerald mine in past interviews as well. In a 2014 interview with Forbes , Musk noted that “This is going to sound slightly crazy, but my father also had a share in an Emerald mine in Zambia.” In posts on Twitter in December 2019, however, Musk noted that his father “didn’t own an emerald mine.” Granted, there’s a notable difference between “owning” a mine and “having a share” in one, but the apparent change in Musk’s narrative is notable. Fortunately, Musk’s recent post on Twitter provided some critical context on why his own interviews and later posts and comments contradict each other. As noted by Musk in his recent post, he actually believed that it was true for some time because his father told him that he owned a share in a mine in Zambia. However, it appears that nobody has really seen the mine, and he and his brother Kimbal are still financially supporting their father, even until today. Musk also shared some thoughts on his complicated relationship with his father. “Our condition of providing him financial support was that he not engage in bad behavior. Unfortunately, he nonetheless did. There are young children involved, so we continued to provide financial support for their well-being. Regarding the so-called “emerald mine”, there is no objective evidence whatsoever that this mine ever existed. He told me that he owned a share in a mine in Zambia, and I believed him for a while, but nobody has ever seen the mine, nor are there any records of its existence. If this mine was real, he would not require financial support from my brother and me,” Musk wrote. I grew up in a lower, transitioning to upper, middle income situation, but did not have a happy childhood. Haven’t inherited anything ever from anyone, nor has anyone given me a large financial gift. My father created a small electrical/mechanical engineering company that was… Whether or not Musk is telling the complete truth in his recent post on Twitter is still up for question. That being said, Musk’s post does explain why his comments and stance on his father’s emerald mine stake have changed over the years. If his post is accurate, then it is true that he believed that his father had a share in an emerald mine in the past, but it is also true that he is very skeptical of the claim today. His recent comments then, one of which is offering 1 million Dogecoins to anyone who can trace the emerald mine related to his father, would make sense. Maye Musk , Elon Musk’s mother, also provided her own thoughts on the matter. As per Maye, she was made aware of the emerald mine story on Twitter about ten years ago. That being said, she also highlighted that when she and her children moved to Toronto in 1989, they stayed at a one-bedroom apartment and later a rent-controlled unit, hardly the accommodations of an extremely wealthy family from South Africa. When we moved to Toronto in 1989, we stayed in a one-bedroom apartment until I found a rent-controlled apartment, which took us three weeks to clean up. We all worked, were happy and optimistic. The first I heard of an emerald mine was on @Twitter about 10 years ago. Thanks for… https://t.co/6gIdvj9Yel To be fair, recent comments from Errol Musk also suggested that the emerald mine that he had a share in was not some grand operation that resulted in generational wealth. “What Elon is saying is that there was no formal mine. It was a rock formation protruding from the ground in the middle of nowhere. There was no mining company. There are no signed agreements or financial statements. No one owned anything. The deal was done on a handshake with the Italian man at a time when Zambia was a free for all. Not even he knew exactly where the border was. At that time, it was like the Wild West,” Errol Musk told news.com.au . Don’t hesitate to contact us with news tips. Just send a message to simon@teslarati.com to give us a heads-up.",

        "content": "| The Phensem Parents Support Group oriented parents, teachers, and Special Education Needs (SEN) Aides to help non-vocal children who are often addressed as Children with Disabilities (CwDs), with alternative modes of communication on 6 May. According to Phensem, many individuals, especially children with autism, are unable to communicate using speech and sound the way most other people do. However, this disability does not necessarily have to limit them from communicating their thoughts and emotions. Organizers said not being able to speak is not a deciding factor in the level of functioning. People with autism possess depth and wisdom, but we do not give them a voice, as per the autism supporting group. Thus the Phensem group conducted a training on “Alternative Modes of Communication” for parents, teachers, and SEN Aides in Thimphu to promote inclusiveness. The training was part of series of four training workshops with focus on four important domains that were identified in the field of inclusive learning and play, and was targeted for parents, teachers, and SEN Aides. Behavior management and positive reinforcement, inclusive play, alternative modes of communication, and technology as an assistive tool for learning for children with disabilities are the four domains. Karma Sonam Dorji, the Co-Founder and Executive Director of Phensem, said the training was conducted as access to learning in schools has been a challenge for children with disabilities who lack the motor skills to read and write the conventional way or even have speech and language issues. “Therefore, the training was to introduce alternative methods and pathways and the use of technology that can be provided to the children to assist them in learning and communicating in school or at home,” Karma said. Karma added that the impact on parents and teachers comes from how to carry out basic assessments to check the current level of communication of the children, how to set up strategy plans, and goal-setting in terms of how to help improve communication skills through different modes of communication. Overall, it is also to introduce augmentative and alternative communication skills. The Dzongkha teacher of Early Learning Center, Yonten Ngedrup, said that equal education opportunity is a basic human right and there is a need for inclusive SEN Aides in all schools. As of now, he pointed out that SEN Aides are only in selective schools. He suggests that if it can be provided in all schools, providing training not only to SEN teachers but even to other selected teachers. This is not to send SEN children to a particular school which is inconvenient for some. The dzongkhag teacher said that non-vocal children in Bhutan are left behind as compared to other countries. He said that training in alternative modes of communication will help CwDs access technologies to improve their communication. The parent of a child with autism, Wangmo, said the training has helped both parents and children communicate. However, she said that aid kits are not available in Bhutan and should be imported from third countries. She said if taxes for imported SEN Aides tools are reduced or waived off if possible. Wangmo usually imports toys from Sri Lanka. About 26 teachers, 10 parents and six SEN aides participated in the training. It is anticipated that about 416 children with disabilities will benefit, according to Phensem. The training was provided by ACC educators from the Communication Department of Vidya Sagar, India. These capacity buildings are supported by the Rotary Club of Thimphu.",

ESA’s Jupiter Ice Moons Explorer spacecraft is on its way to the Jovian System, where it’ll be mapping out several of its icy moons. Unfortunately, a critical antenna has failed to deploy. The 16-meter radar antenna should have been fully deployed, but it’s only unfolded about a third of the way. Engineers think a tiny pin might be protruding out and blocking it from extending. Their next plan is to try firing its engines to shake the spacecraft and deploy the antenna. They’ve still got time. Juice won’t arrive at Jupiter until 2031.

In the past, we’ve seen evidence of such events but never saw it actually happen. A hot Jupiter got to close to its parent star and got destroyed by the tidal forces. It was just 12,000 light-years away, so pretty close. Actually, the Earth might one day follow the same path when the Sun becomes a red giant and expands. More about the planet getting eaten by its star Although SpaceX’s Starship cleared the launch pad, it didn’t make it to orbit. Instead, the enormous rocket gouged out a giant hole in the concrete at its launch pad and rained debris around it. The flight termination system failed to destroy the rocket as quickly as SpaceX had hoped. Because of these issues, the FAA has placed an indefinite hold on rocket launches from Boca Chica while SpaceX fixes the problems. According to Elon Musk, they’ll be ready for another test in 6-8 weeks, but we’ll see if they clear the regulatory hurdles by then. More about SpaceX Starship Airbus showed a concept of an orbital space station called Loop. One interesting aspect of it is a centrifuge at the bottom. It is designed to provide some extent of artificial gravity to mitigate the negative effects that weightlessness has on the human body. So far there have been few realistic concepts of space stations that incorporate artificial gravity. However, it is worth noting that Loop is also just a concept for now with no announced plans for development or launch. More about Airbus Loop space station Most planets we know about rotate roughly within the same orbital plane. For example, all planets in the Solar System are aligned within several degrees of the ecliptic. However, an exoplanet seems to be breaking these rules. Astronomers knew about an exoplanet called WASP-131b for a while, but just recently they were able to measure the rotation of its star. It appears that the planet’s plane of rotation is tilted 160 degrees. So, practically, it rotates backwards at a very weird angle. For now, it’s unclear how it turned out this way. Captured rogue planet? More research is needed. More about the strange exoplanet Almost every galaxy in the Universe contains a supermassive black hole at its heart, and every 10,000 years or so, each of these black holes rips apart a star that got too close. Astronomers have found the closest example of one of these “tidal disruption events” (TDE) in a galaxy that’s merely 137 million light-years away (that’s close, cosmologically speaking). They found the event by searching through infrared images of the sky, which has provided a promising way to find more of them. More about a black hole destroying a star China’s Mars rover, Zhurong, is officially dead. We have known it for quite a while now, but finally, we have an official statement from China. As expected, it didn’t survive the Martian winter and succumbed to the cold and dust. There’s still a very little glimpse of hope it can revive but it’s highly unlikely. After such a time without power, its batteries are most probably dead. More about China’s Mars rover NASA released a series of images captured by its ShadowCam instrument. It’s onboard the Korean Danuri spacecraft, revealing the Moon’s low-light regions with 200 times more sensitivity than other lunar orbiters. Thanks to ShadowCam, NASA could look into the permanently shadowed craters at the Moon’s South Pole, which are never lit up by the Sun. Regions seen by ShadowCam are illuminated by indirect sunlight reflecting off nearby rocks as well as Earthshine.

        "content": "The surface of Mars is a pretty desolate place at first glance. The soil is many times as dry as the driest desert on planet Earth, the temperatures swing from one extreme to the other, and the air is incredibly thin and toxic. And yet, there’s ample evidence that the planet was once much warmer and wetter, with lots of flowing and standing water on its surface. Over time, as Mars’ atmosphere was slowly stripped away, much of this water was lost to space, and what remains is largely concentrated around the poles as glacial ice and permafrost. For years, space agencies have been sending robotic landers, rovers, orbiters, and aerial vehicles to Mars to learn more about when this transition took and how long it took. According to China’s Tianwen-1 mission, which includes the Zhurong rover, there may have been liquid water on the Martian surface later than previously thought. According to new research from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the Zhurong rover observed salt-rich dunes in the Utopia Planitia region that showed cracks and crusts, indicating the possible presence of water as recently as a few hundred thousand years ago. The research team was co-led by Xiaoguang Qin and Xu Wang of the Key Laboratory of Cenozoic Geology and Environment at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics; and Xin Ren and Jianjun Liu of the Key Laboratory of Lunar and Deep Space Exploration (part of the National Astronomical Observatories). They were joined by many additional researchers from these respective institutions, the College of Earth and Planetary Sciences , and the Institute of Atmospheric Physics . Their findings were described in a paper that appeared in Science Advances on April 28th. Remove All Ads on Universe Today Join our Patreon for as little as $3! Get the ad-free experience for life As they describe, the Zhurong rover observed interesting features on the surfaces of Barchan dunes in Utopia Planitia, a massive plain and the largest impact basin in the Solar System. These dunes are a characteristic feature in Mars’ northern hemisphere that are similar to dunes that appear in deserts all across Earth. These result from high winds depositing sand in a crescent shape, with the curved side facing in the direction of the wind. When observing a patch of dunes in the southern part of Utopia Planitia, Zhurong noted crusts, cracks, aggregates, and bright polygonal ridges. The team concluded that these features were formed from small pockets of water from thawing frost or snow mixed with mineral salts. Once the water sublimated in Mars’ atmosphere, patches of hard crust and loose material were left behind, along with depressions and ridges. Like other features that formed in the presence of water, these were then preserved by Mars’ extremely cold and dry atmosphere. But unlike other features that are hundreds of eons or billions of years old, the team estimates that these features formed between 1.4 million and 400,000 years ago (perhaps even more recently). As they explain in their paper, the team was able to rule out the possibility that frozen carbon dioxide (“dry ice”) and wind were responsible: “Instead, involvement of saline water from thawed frost/snow is the most likely cause. This discovery sheds light on more humid conditions of the modern Martian climate and provides critical clues to future exploration missions searching for signs of extant life, particularly at low latitudes with comparatively warmer, more amenable surface temperatures.” During the period in question, the Martian environment was much as it is today (i.e., extremely cold and dry). Therefore, these findings indicate that a hydrological cycle existed recently on Mars, far more recent than previously thought. The team also ran computer simulations and combined them with observations made by other robotic missions. These indicated that conditions could be suitable in other regions on Mars for frost and ice to form during certain times of the year, leading to similar features elsewhere. This is consistent with observations made by robotic missions since NASA’s Viking 1 and 2 missions explored Mars in the late 1970s. However, scientists were of the general opinion that morning frost only occurred in certain locations and under highly-constrained conditions. This discovery indicates that there could be periodic patches of liquid water on Mars today in other regions, though the amount would be very small. As the study authors state: “This discovery sheds light on more humid conditions of the modern Martian climate and provides critical clues to future exploration missions searching for signs of extant life, particularly at low latitudes with comparatively warmer, more amenable surface temperatures.” This discovery could also point toward the existence of small patches of fertile ground where microbial life could still exist today. Of course, additional studies are needed before any of this can be said with confidence. Those studies may or may have to wait on future missions, as the rover has not yet woken up from hibernation. According to Zhang Rongqiao, chief designer of Tianwen-1, this is likely due to the build-up of dust on the rover’s solar panels. Like NASA’s Insight and Opportunity missions, this could prevent the mission from operating ever again. Since it rolled off of the Tianwen-1 lander on May 22nd, 2021, the rover spent roughly a year exploring the surface of Mars before it went into hibernation on May 20th, 2022. Since it was designed to operate for just 90 Martian days (sols), or 93 Earth days, the rover has vastly exceeded its intended lifespan. As of May 5th, 2022 , Zhurong also managed to travel 1,921 meters (1.194 mi) across the surface. If the China National Space Agency is unable to reactivate the rover before long and decides to conclude the mission, Zhurong could not have picked a more profound discovery to go out on!

        "content": "Like any toddler, the infant Sun was an absolute trial. It kicked and screamed, lashing the space around it with powerful superflares every few days. Once upon a time, we thought that these outbursts would have posed a hindrance to life on Earth. But evidence suggests they may have been the trigger that kicked it all off, as solar particles collided with molecules in Earth's early atmosphere to create the basic building blocks that would later combine to create life. Now by bombarding a replica of the primordial atmosphere with simulated solar particles and lightning in the laboratory, researchers have created amino acids and carboxylic acids – two of the essential basic ingredients for proteins and life. \"We have, for the first time, experimentally shown that the production rates of amino acids and carboxylic acids in non-reducing gas mixtures … due to proton irradiation can significantly exceed the production rates of these molecules via galactic cosmic rays and spark discharges,\" write a team led by chemist Kensei Kobayashi of Yokohama National University in Japan. \"This provides experimental evidence supporting the importance of solar energetic particle events in the young Sun as energy sources which were required for the synthesis of the biologically important molecules deposited and accumulated in diverse aquatic geological settings of the early Earth.\" Earth is the only place in the Universe on which we know for a certainty that life exists. Yet we don't know why some 4 billion years ago complex chemistry began to self-replicate like it did. We have a very rough idea of the basics, but the specifics are proving a little tricky to piece together. For a long time, scientists thought that lightning might play a role, interacting with molecules, heat, and water to form amino acids, the basic molecules on which life is built. Experiments seemed to suggest this was accurate. When gasses thought to constitute Earth's early atmosphere were combined and zapped with sparks in 1953, amino acids formed . Back then, we thought Earth's early atmosphere was infused with large amounts of methane, ammonia, water vapor, and molecular hydrogen. Given those assumptions, experiments tended to focus on gas mixtures consisting of these substances. Later research, however, showed that Earth's atmosphere wasn't so rich in methane and ammonia after all. Rather, it was dominated by gasses produced by volcanic activity – carbon dioxide and molecular nitrogen, with just a small amount of methane. Similar spark experiments performed on this mixture resulted in a very inefficient amino acid production. It was then suggested galactic cosmic rays might have been involved. Experiments mimicking this process irradiated a simulated early atmosphere with protons, resulting in more suitable production of amino acids. But whether the irradiation of galactic cosmic rays was sufficient during Earth's early development to provide the kind of chemistry necessary for life remained debatable. A breakthrough came several years ago in 2016 when a team led by solar scientists Vladimir Airapetian of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center decided to take a closer look at the Sun. This seems a little counter-intuitive; the Sun's early behavior, at first glance, doesn't seem conducive to life-yielding conditions. Not only was it very cranky, it was cooler and dimmer, at only 70 percent of its current output. Airapetian and his team showed that the Sun's crankiness could have compensated for its coldness, lashing Earth with superflares that could have warmed Earth despite the coolness of the Sun, and triggered chemical reactions that produced prebiotic molecules. Kobayashi, who has spent decades investigating prebiotic chemistry, reached out to Airapetian to investigate. The team made a number of gas mixtures simulating hypothetical atmospheres of early Earth, containing molecular nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane in various proportions. These mixtures were placed in a chamber, where they were subjected to either proton irradiation, to mimic the effect of solar flares, or electrical discharges, to simulate lightning. The effects were fascinating. The researchers found that the mixture needed to constitute at least 15 percent methane for the sparks to produce amino acids, which is not a small amount at all. However, the simulated solar particles produced amino acids and carboxylic acid with a mixture that was just 0.5 percent methane. It's far from a smoking gun, but it does suggest that rampant solar activity could have played a significant role in life's origins. And although lightning could have played some role, it was likely a much lesser contributor. \"And even at 15 percent methane, the production rate of the amino acids by lightning is a million times less than by protons,\" Airapetian says . \"During cold conditions you never have lightning, and early Earth was under a pretty faint sun. That's not saying that it couldn't have come from lightning, but lightning seems less likely now, and solar particles seem more likely.\" This could be an important clue as to how and why we got here, but it could also help astronomers identify where prebiotic chemistry may have formed elsewhere, as well. For example, NASA's Curiosity rover found abundant nitrates on the surface of Mars , which suggests that nitrogen fixation (combining molecular nitrogen with other elements to form compounds) was relatively efficient once upon a time on Mars. Perhaps the tempestuous Sun had a hand there, too. The research has been published in Life .",

        "description": "Mamedi asserted that the company will be compliant with the upcoming data protection laws in India",
        "content": "New Delhi: As Swedish caller identification app Truecaller touched 250 million active users milestone in India, CEO and co-founder Alan Mamedi believes there is still a lot of headroom for growth here, and does not anticipate any changes in how its “privacy-focused, permission-based system” works as new regulations come up in the country. Mamedi asserted that the company will be compliant with the upcoming data protection laws in India and “welcomes any and all actions in the mission to make communication safe and efficient”. Mamedi, who was recently in India along with Truecaller’s Chief Strategy Officer and co-founder Nami Zarringhalam, said the company appreciates Trai consultation on Caller Name Presentation (CNAP) and remains “very supportive of this and any future initiatives they have”. The telecom regulatory authority of India (Trai) recently asked telecom companies to take immediate action to curb pesky calls and messages, initiating a slew of measures to crackdown on the issue of spam, and instances of fraud. Truecaller said it remains focused on core aspects of its service, that is, protecting the highest number of people from unwanted or malicious communication. “There is a lot of room to grow, even in India. We currently have 250 million active users here, even though there may be over 500 million data connected smartphones,” Mamedi told PTI. On new regulations such as Digital India and digital personal data protection bill that are taking shape, Truecaller CEO affirmed that the company is already compliant with data protection laws in many other nations, and will abide by upcoming norms in India as well. To a specific question on whether the company sees challenges to its business model from the new rules in offing in India, Mamedi said, “We do not anticipate any changes in how Truecaller works as a result of upcoming regulation.” Truecaller “is already a privacy-focused and permission-based system”, he emphasised. Asked if Truecaller’s data collection processes and practices will stand the scrutiny of the new data protection law that India is proposing, Mamedi in an email interview said: “We have been compliant with all data protection laws introduced in other countries from day one and this is not really an issue or anything new to us. And we will also be compliant with the upcoming data protection laws in India.” In fact, he added, all India users’ data was localised in here more than five years ago, well ahead of any regulatory requirements. Truecaller has recently hit this new 350 million-milestone and launched SMS Fraud Protection which, Mamedi said, is indicating “great results” to curb growing cyber frauds and scams. Mamedi and Zarringhalam met investors and external partners during their India visit, last month. “Due to paucity of time, we could only visit Bengaluru where we have our new office. We met our teams here and also discussed the upcoming projects and recent launches which we recently announced in public,” Mamedi said. The company has also inaugurated its largest office outside of Sweden, in Bengaluru. And while it has smaller offices in Gurugram and Mumbai, Mamedi said if the need arises, Truecaller may also consider opening offices in smaller cities to better serve different parts of the country. “One of the big updates is that we are in the process of launching Truecaller Call Assistant for Android users and some more interesting features for iOS as well,” the Truecaller top boss informed. The company is seeing a healthy growth in other large regions outside of India as well, “which is exciting”. “Our verified business listings continues to grow and there are almost 2,000 large business customers across 36 countries,” Mamedi elaborated. All of the features within the Truecaller app are fully consent-based, Mamedi pointed out. “There are some misconceptions about how the app and service works. Truecaller does not harvest user’s contacts/address books or make them publicly searchable when you download the app from Google Play or iPhone App Store,” he said, adding that Truecaller is community-driven service that relies on direct feedback from millions of users each day.",

            "content": "The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is in the midst of a predicament as its officers have apparently requested leave until June in order to protest against the rising inflation that is affecting their ability to make ends meet. In a letter addressed to the FBR Chairman Asim Ahmed, 117 Income Tax officers ranging from grades 17 to 19 have expressed their discontent with a meagre pay scale. “Due to low pay, we are unable to meet the expenses of coming to the office in this era of skyrocketing inflation,” the letter stated. This issue is extremely worrisome as the absence of these officers during the crucial budgeting process could have grave consequences for the country’s economy since the FBR is accountable for collecting taxes and revenue for the government. The FBR Chairman has promised to raise the matter of the officers’ salary scale with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Additionally, he mentioned that the tax officers’ performance allowance has been withheld since 2015. It’s worth noting that an FBR officer made a peculiar request in a separate incident. In a letter addressed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the officer requested permission to engage in corrupt activities in order to cover domestic expenses in the face of soaring inflation.

            "content": "Kia Lucky Motor Corporation has introduced a new version of its Sportage SUV, named the ‘Black Limited Edition.’ This latest model is the top-of-the-line version of Sportage in Pakistan. The company recently held an unveiling event of the vehicle for its clients and industry experts in major cities across Pakistan, where they discussed the enhancements made to the latest variant. The ‘Black Edition’ is primarily a cosmetic package and comes exclusively with an All-Wheel Drive (AWD) powertrain configuration. The new variant features a gloss black front grille, 19″ gloss black alloy rims, gloss black rear scuff-plate, dark-satin mouldings, darkened Kia, Sportage, and AWD emblems, and an all-black leather-wrapped interior. However, the primary features and performance figures of the new model remain the same as the standard Sportage. Kia plans to produce the ‘Black Edition’ for a limited time, which could last up to a year. While the new model is visually appealing, its price is relatively high compared to other SUVs on the market. According to , the Sportage Black Edition is priced at Rs9.05 million, which is significantly more than its competitors like the MG HS and Hyundai Tucson. Despite the cost, given the Sportage’s overall popularity, the ‘Black Edition’ may still prove to be a big success.

The Nifty 50 closed 1.08% higher at 18,264.40, while the S&P BSE Sensex rose 1.16% to 61,764.25. Both benchmarks posted their best single-day gains in over a month.

            "content": "The price of consumer goods and services in the market showed an increase by 3.15 percent in March this year, according to data from the National Statistics Bureau (NSB). However, this is a decline of 2.43 percentage points compared to the same month last year, indicating that the rate of increase has slowed down. The report also revealed that the rate of increase dropped for both food and non-food items. The price of food increased by 0.75 percent while non-food increased by 5.23 percent. Transportation prices in March showed an increase of 6.72 percent, although this figure is lower by 5.44 percentage points compared to the same month last year. This is attributed to the decrease in the price of fuel. In the food category, the prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 0.48 percent, while the prices of alcoholic beverages and betel nuts recorded an increase of 4.48 percent. Meanwhile, the CPI is a measure of the average change in the prices of goods and services bought by households in a particular country over time. It is a widely used economic indicator that helps track the rate of inflation and the purchasing power of consumers. The CPI is calculated by taking a basket of goods and services that are commonly purchased by consumers such as food, housing, clothing, transportation and healthcare and tracking their prices over time. Meanwhile, the month-on-month Consumer Price Index (CPI) in March decreased by 0.35 percent compared to February. The prices of both food and non-food items decreased by 0.58 percent and 0.15 percent respectively. Meanwhile, the price for transport decreased by 0.76 percent in March. A decrease in prices has been recorded for both divisions under the food category, with food and non-alcoholic beverages decreasing by 0.53 percent, and alcoholic beverages and betel nuts decreasing by 1.18 percent. Additionally, the data from the NSB suggests a moderate increase in the prices of consumer goods and services in March 2023. However, this figure is lower compared to the same month last year, indicating a trend towards more stable pricing in the market. Meanwhile, from 2020 to 2021, the price of household goods and services grew by 7.35 percent. This represents a 1.72 percentage point increase above the 5.63 percent increase in 2020. The higher rate in 2021 was attributable to a 5.62 percent increase in non-food, compared to a 1.24 percent increase in 2020. Food costs accounted for over 60 percent of all inflation in 2021, with non-food prices accounting for 40 percent of the total rise. Food prices were the primary driver of inflation in 2020, accounting for about 90 percent of the entire rise. Food and alcoholic drinks provided more than half of the overall rise in 2021, followed by transportation, which contributed about 15 percent, and clothes and footwear, which contributed approximately 11 percent. In 2021, the largest rise was 16.66 percent for alcoholic drinks and betel nuts, while the lowest increase was 0.66 percent for school expenses. Except for communication, which fell by 9.90 percent, all other divisions increased.",

            "description": "Negativity engulfed the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), as the benchmark KSE-100 Index registered a decline of over 450 points during the trading session on Monday. At around 3:10pm, the KSE-100 Index was being traded at 41,778.53, a decline of 463.45 points or 1.1%. KSE-100 rises 0.35% amid low investor participation Across-the-board selling was witnessed as index-heavy sectors including automobile, chemical, cement, commercial banks, oil & gas exploration companies and OMCs were trading in the red. Experts said the delay in resumption of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme is leading to this negative sentiment. “Pakistan’s inability to secure a staff-level agreement (SLA) with the IMF is leading to this drag,” Sana Tawfik, analyst at Arif Habib Limited (AHL), told Business Recorder. The IMF on Friday reiterated that it is working with Pakistani authorities to bring the pending ninth review to conclusion “once the necessary financing is in place and the agreement is finalised”. “In addition, the IMF supports the authorities in the implementation of policies in the period ahead, including in the technical work to prepare the FY24 budget, which is to be passed by the National Assembly before end-June,” Nathan Porter, the IMF Mission Chief for Pakistan, was quoted as saying in a statement to Business Recorder. The development comes as Pakistan remains engaged with the Washington-based lender to resume its bailout programme that has been stalled at the ninth review since November last year. Meanwhile, Tawfik on Monday said the earlier positive sentiment was driven by the robust result season which has ended. “At present, there is no new development in sight to drive upward the momentum,” said the analyst. “Market is also closely monitoring the development at the political front,” she added. The talks between the government and the Pakistan Tehreek-e- Insaf (PTI) to decide on an election date concluded without any result. This is an intra-day update",

            "content": "A letter sent by law firm ENSAfrica to Pretoria high court deputy judge president Aubrey Ledwaba asking him not set down for hearing a case of contempt of court against its clients, has been referred to as an attempt to delay justice by manipulating the court system. In a letter dated April 11, ENSAfrica requested Ledwaba not the set the matter down , which involves its clients, Umsobomvu Coal miner and its owner Lunga Kunene, and one of the law firm’s lawyers, Senzo Mbatha. This because, it said, it was appealing a judgment in which a subpoena that led to the contempt of court allegations was set aside. The subpoena was for records held by the Department of Minerals and Energy on the transfer of mineral rights to coal miner TransAsia Minerals SA. “Pending the finalisation of the appeal proceedings, we respectfully submit that the aforesaid application for contempt cannot be allocated a hearing date on the opposed roll and accordingly request that no date be allocated in the circumstances,” said the law firm. In response, the opposing parties in the case, Mabuza Attorneys, said they were “astonished by the brazen attempt of ENSAfrica to usurp the authority of the deputy judge president by attempting to dictate that a certain case should not be set down for argument”. Mabuza Attorneys, acting on behalf of TransAsia Minerals SA and a subsidiary, Trans-Asia 444, said there was “no substance to the request”. “The contempt proceedings are separate and distinct from the pending leave to appeal concerning the subpoena. “This is made clear in the judgment, which struck the contempt application and granted the application for the setting aside of the subpoena,” said lawyer Eric Mabuza in a letter dated April 12. “The request is, therefore, a transparent attempt to prevent or delay the finalisation of the contempt proceedings. An attorney cannot deliberately make themselves a party to delay the finalisation of proceedings. In fact, the duty of an attorney is to ensure the expeditious resolution of disputes.” He said it was ironic that the contempt charges came up after ENSAfrica tried to enforce a subpoena granted by the high court when an appeal against the subpoena had already been lodged with the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. He said ENSAfrica’s attempts to undermine the authority of the appeal court led to the urgent application on February 27, in which the subpoena was set aside, but the contempt charge was struck off the roll for lack of urgency. The urgent application was heard on March 16 and in a judgment on March 24, Judge Harshila Kooverjie ruled that TransAsia Minerals and its subsidiary “failed to satisfy the court that [the contempt issue] should be dealt with on an urgent basis”. Kooverjie agreed with ENSAfrica that “this issue can be dealt with in the normal course of the proceedings”. Consequently, on April 5 TransAsia Minerals SA and TransAsia 444 enrolled the contempt charge on the opposed roll of the Pretoria high court. ENSAfrica told Ledwaba the matter was enrolled while the period to appeal against the urgent court’s decision to set aside the subpoena had not expired. According to a “notice of set down” Sunday World saw, on April 19 the contempt case was set down for hearing on May 22.

            "content": "President Biden is set to welcome Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other top congressional leaders to the White House on Tuesday for a about the nation’s taxes, spending and debt as a potentially catastrophic government default rapidly approaches. The talks come just weeks before the United States is to pay its bills unless the nation’s borrowing cap is lifted. Like previous moments of brinkmanship, the discussions have echoes of 2011 and 2013, when congressional Republicans refused to raise the debt ceiling unless a Democratic president agreed to curb federal spending and reduce budget deficits. The same dynamic is at play now, but with a crucial difference: The parties share almost no common ground on tax and spending proposals that are meant to reduce the growth of the nation’s . The meeting is not expected to produce anything close to final agreement on a fiscal plan that could include raising the debt limit. But even small points of consensus could be hard to come by. Mr. Biden wants to expand federal spending and reduce future debt, largely by . Republicans have to cut federal discretionary spending — a category that includes national parks, education and more — and cancel tax breaks for certain low-emission energy sources that were part of Mr. Biden’s signature climate law. Republicans have promised to extend the 2017 tax cuts that were approved by President Donald J. Trump and are set to expire at the end of 2025. While both sides say they want to reduce the nation’s future debt burden, there is almost no overlap in how they aim to achieve that outcome. The only point of agreement so far is on the one thing Mr. Biden and Mr. McCarthy consider off limits in budget talks: Social Security and Medicare, the primary sources of projected federal spending growth in the decades to come. The gulf on fiscal issues is one of several complicating factors in discussions over the debt limit, which the government technically . Officials have been employing what are essentially accounting maneuvers to keep paying all the government’s bills on time without going over the current $31.4 trillion limit. But Janet L. Yellen, the Treasury secretary, warned in a letter last week that those efforts will no longer be possible , risking a debt default that economists warn could spawn a financial crisis and recession. Lawmakers will need to reach a bipartisan agreement to lift the debt limit. The longer it takes, the more turmoil there could be for the United States and the global economy. Mr. Biden has refused to negotiate directly over the limit, saying Republicans must vote to raise it without conditions, given that it simply allows the government to pay for spending that lawmakers in both parties have already approved. But he invited Mr. McCarthy and other congressional leaders to come to the White House on Tuesday for what he called a separate negotiation on fiscal policy — even though it is effectively linked to the debt limit drama. Republicans say they will not raise the limit without significant curbs in spending. That is the same position they took in 2011 and 2013, under President Barack Obama, when Mr. Biden was vice president. They did not make similar demands to raise the limit when they controlled Congress at the start of Mr. Trump’s term and Republican votes helped to effectively raise the limit. In 2011, Mr. Obama entered debt limit negotiations with a . They included a five-year freeze on discretionary spending not related to national security, a separate freeze on federal workers’ salaries for two years and the elimination of an air-to-air missile program and a fighting vehicle for the Marine Corps. Republicans that featured deep cuts to federal health care spending, privatizing Medicare for future beneficiaries and new tax cuts. Republicans ultimately agreed to raise the debt limit in exchange for centered on caps on discretionary spending — essentially modifying and expanding the spending freeze Mr. Obama had proposed in his budget. Unlike Mr. Obama more than a decade ago, Mr. Biden has never agreed with Republicans’ argument that federal spending has grown too large. He has proposed to scale back the growth in government debt, but his aides reject the Republican contention that the current path of the debt poses a significant threat to economic growth. Mr. Biden’s most recent budget to reduce future deficits. The savings would come largely from tax increases on the wealthy and big corporations, along with cutting government spending on health care by broadening Medicare’s ability to negotiate prescription drug prices. Republicans have rejected all the tax increases and criticized Mr. Biden earlier this year for not proposing to spend even more on the military than he already did. House Republicans have not put forth or passed a budget. The bill they passed last month would raise the debt limit by $1.5 trillion or through March 2024, whichever came first. It would reduce future deficits by nearly $5 trillion, largely by freezing certain federal spending for a decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It also included new supports for fossil fuels, a rollback of Mr. Biden’s climate change agenda and an end to the president’s attempt to cancel student loan debt for most borrowers, which regardless. Neither side has found anything to like in the other’s starting position. Republicans “didn’t produce a budget,” Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the Democratic leader, who will join Mr. McCarthy at the White House meeting, told NBC News on Sunday. “What they did was produce a ransom note.” Representative Jodey C. Arrington of Texas, the chairman of the Budget Committee, countered that Mr. Biden would have to relent and negotiate with Republicans. Mr. Biden “has negotiated, as vice president and as a senator, debt ceiling increases, with common-sense spending controls and fiscal reforms,” Mr. Arrington told Fox News on Sunday. “And we’re just asking him to be a responsible leader and do that again.”",

                "description": "Mined and simulated diamonds differ greatly when it comes to price — and synthetic diamonds might not be as sustainable as you thought.",
                "content": "ilbusca via Getty Images According to the experts, there is no way for the average person to differentiate a natural from a lab-grown diamond. If you’ve bought a piece of fine jewelry containing a diamond in recent years, you’ve likely encountered a more affordable option in a lab-grown diamond — especially if you were in the market for an engagement ring . While you may shell out around $23,000 for a 2-carat halo ring of natural diamonds, the lab-grown version of the same ring might cost $6,000 — a staggering difference for two options that are visually, chemically and physically the same. Advertisement Laboratory-grown, or synthetic, diamonds are more popular than ever as consumers are drawn to their affordability compared to mined, or natural, diamonds. Plus, sustainability and ethics are now top of mind for many diamond shoppers, even more so since the 2006 film “Blood Diamond” shed light on many of the inhumane practices in traditional diamond mining. But when you ask the experts, the differences between mined and lab-grown diamonds aren’t so cut and dry — especially where ethics and sustainability are concerned. We talked to four industry experts to break it down. Synthetic diamonds are created in a laboratory, and they sometimes begin as a tiny piece of a natural diamond. As the name implies, lab-grown diamonds are created in a laboratory, rather than harvested from nature. “Technically speaking, there are two ways of producing lab-grown diamonds,” explained Avi Levy, the president of North America for the International Gemological Institute . “The first is the high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) method, where heavy mechanical presses and intense heat are combined to replicate the conditions under which natural diamonds formed. The second is chemical vapor deposition (CVD), a process that superheats gas into plasma, releasing carbon atoms to ‘build’ a diamond crystal at the atomic level.” Advertisement Both methods actually start with a tiny piece of a mined diamond. “A sliver of a natural diamond ‘seed’ [is] placed in a chamber,” said Anna Bario, co-founder of Bario Neal , which sells both lab-grown and natural diamonds. “The lab then adds carbon and heat, mimicking the way that diamonds form naturally in the Earth. The seed then grows and grows into a high-quality diamond.” And while “both of these methods grow real diamonds,” said Levy, “ one process (CVD) assembles the diamond in vertical layers and the other (HPHT) uses a metal catalyst to dissolve component carbon. These different approaches may produce microscopic inclusions (internal characteristics) which differ from those seen in natural diamonds, but not always. Once polished, both HPHT and CVD produce gemstones that look identical to natural diamonds. ” To the naked eye, there is no difference between a mined and lab-grown diamond. According to the experts, there is no way for the average person to differentiate a natural from a lab-grown diamond. “There are no differences to the naked eye,” Levy said. “Lab-grown diamonds are real diamonds, scientifically, chemically, physically and optically. You can only separate natural and lab-grown diamonds with sophisticated testing.” They’re also identical when it comes to hardness, both scoring a 10 (the highest value) on the Mohs scale, which is used to define hardness of materials. There are two ways that trained experts can spot a synthetic diamond. “There are small but significant differences in inclusions and growth structure that allow a trained gemologist to distinguish between natural and lab-created diamonds. These differences may only be identified under extreme magnification,” said George Leifheit, vice president of global strategic sourcing for Signet, the parent company of Kay , which sells both lab-grown and natural diamonds. Advertisement Another method is by a tiny inscription, which is required in a lab-grown diamond. “Per the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, all lab-created diamonds are required to carry the label ‘lab-created’ or ‘lab-grown’ so the consumer can have confidence in the diamond they are buying,” added Leifheit. Lab-grown diamonds are much cheaper than natural diamonds, even of the same quality. Since visually and chemically, the two vareities are the same, the biggest discernible difference is the price point — and it’s a substantial one. When picking a lab-grown diamond over a natural one, “you can frequently double the carat weight for the same budget,” Levy said. Diamonds are graded based on their clarity, cut, carat and color (known as the four Cs). If a natural diamond and a lab-grown diamond rank equally in all four categories, the lab-created version will be significantly cheaper — about 20-30% cheaper on average, estimated Leifheit, adding, “The price difference will increase as the carat size goes up.” picture alliance via Getty Images At the DDI Foundation German Diamond Institute, a natural diamond with 3.53 carats is placed in a diamond tester. The device is used to test whether the diamonds are synthetic or natural. Simply put, with lab-created diamonds, you get more for your money. “They offer large finger coverage for a more affordable price,” Bario said. Advertisement The reason for the financial variation is based on the rarity and the history of a mined diamond. “Materials from the Earth, like mined diamonds and gemstones, are cosmic-level pieces of planetary history,” Bario explained. “They formed into existence over centuries, long before we held them, and those ancient elements can’t be replicated in a lab.” “One day, the Earth will run out of economic diamond mines, but synthetic diamond manufacturing offers an inexhaustible supply,” said Jessica Cadzow-Collins, a qualified gemologist, former heritage director of Garrard (which made many of the U.K.’s crown jewels over 140 years) and founder of Jessica May Jewels . “ Natural diamonds are being depleted, and in time … access to natural diamonds will almost certainly run out. The cost of natural diamonds has risen slowly but steadily over the last 30 years and continues to do so.” There’s also a major disparity when it comes to resale value. “Synthetic diamonds are cheap and plentiful and are made by a widely replicated process compared to natural diamonds, so there is absolutely no resale value,” Cadzow-Collins added. “Natural diamonds retain their value indefinitely.” Both lab-grown and mined diamonds can be more and less sustainable, depending on a company’s process. Though many people assume that purchasing a lab-grown diamond will be a more sustainable and ethical choice than purchasing a mined diamond, that’s not always the case. Part of that is due to the recent positive changes in the diamond mining industry. Advertisement “ When it comes to natural diamonds, no other industry has done more to oppose ‘conflict minerals’ (including gold, tin, tungsten, coltan, etc.) than the modern diamond industry,” Levy said. “The world’s largest miners have put programs in place partnering with Indigenous people and communities where their diamonds are extracted. There are still geopolitical issues impacting supply in places … but since the end of the last century sweeping changes have taken place in the interest of environmental, social and governance (ESG) — the framework used to assess an organization’s business practices and performance on various sustainability and ethical issues.” Moreover, “many consumers might also think that an advantage of cultivated diamonds is ‘zero impact’ on the environment, however, that claim is not possible for lab-grown or mined diamonds (or really any inorganic object that’s human-made),” Bario said. “Both require water and nonrenewable energies like oil, gas or coal to fuel them.” In fact, depending on exactly how it’s done and who is doing the growing, diamond creation in a laboratory setting may not be sustainable at all due to “the vast amount of electricity that is required to power six weeks of unimaginable amount of heat and pressure required in the advanced technological processes that replicate the dense carbon crystal lattices of diamond,” Cadzow-Collins noted. Still, there are ways to create a diamond more responsibly than others. “ Some lab-grown diamond producers have emerged using hydro and solar power, and they can provide third-party scientific proof of sustainability from organizations such as SCS Global,” Levy said. If sustainability is important to you when purchasing a lab-grown diamond, it’s imperative to research your retailer. “If you are choosing a lab diamond from a jeweler, it’s important to question where they are sourcing the lab diamonds. Are they produced in the USA? Are there any carbon offsets made during the manufacturing? Where are the diamonds faceted and polished?” Bario said. Advertisement Kristen Starke A moissanite engagement ring sits atop a stack of rings. Moissanite is another affordable alternative, but you can see the difference. For people looking for affordable alternatives to mined diamonds, moissanite presents another good option — although this colorless stone can be discerned from a diamond with the naked eye. A 2-carat moissanite stone might be around $3,500, Bario noted, where a lab-grown diamond of the same carat weight might be around $6,000. “Similar to cultivated [lab-grown] diamonds, [moissanite] is more accessibly priced than mined natural diamonds. Moissanite is nearly as hard as diamonds, so stones can be worn every day and in a variety of sizes. The only visible difference might be the sparkle. If you’re really paying attention, a large moissanite will cast a rainbow shine, while a natural diamond has a truer white sparkle,” Bario said. Although moissanite is most commonly created in a lab due to its rarity in the Earth, “it’s much easier to manufacture than diamond,” Cadzow-Collins noted. Other alternatives, such as white topaz and cubic zirconia, “are softer with rounded facet edges and are generally less sparkly,” she added. Still, despite alternatives like lab-grown diamonds being more prevalent than ever, they still only account for 2% of the total diamond jewelry market, estimated Cadzow-Collins, though synthetic diamonds are expected to “grow to about 5% over the next decade.” Advertisement And in the engagement ring industry, Leifheit noted, “natural diamonds are still the leading gemstone.” Related Environment Sustainability Diamonds If Your Mom Thinks She Doesn’t Need A Mother’s Day Gift, Perhaps These Legions Of Positive Reviews Will Sway Her Etsy Is A Great Place To Shop Unique Mother's Day Jewelry Target's Newest Jewelry Launch Is Perfect For Mother's Day Gifting Go To Homepage Before You Go The Cutest Minimal Gold Jewelry Gifts On Etsy See Gallery Suggest a correction Talia Ergas On Assignment For HuffPost You May Like",

The star of TV’s “Hercules” in the 1990s but who now focuses on Christian films and right-wing conspiracy theories wrote on Twitter: Advertisement Assault weapons aren’t real. Just like there’s no such thing as an assult car, or assault pencil. Stop blaming objects when the person is at fault. — Kevin Sorbo (@ksorbs) May 7, 2023 Sorbo’s tweet came one day after a gunman killed eight people and wounded seven others at an outlet mall in Texas, and as a recent wave of mass shootings is leading to renewed calls for increased gun control. A Fox News poll released last month , for example, found the majority of Americans want tighter gun control laws and better enforcement of existing regulations. More specifically, 61% favor bans on the assault weapons that Sorbo claims “aren’t real.” As a result, his tweet was widely shared ― but probably not for the reasons he would’ve hoped: Pencils are smarter than you. https://t.co/lY6Cle3taI — Spiro’s Ghost (@AntiToxicPeople) May 7, 2023 Advertisement Fine then, let's regulate guns as much as cars. #GunRefo — Craig Rozniecki (@CraigRozniecki) May 7, 2023 Hard to kill 12 or 14 people with a knife.

                "content": "The Chronicle Award-winning music producer DJ Maphorisa allegedly grabbed actress Thuli Phongolo by her neck and dragged her to the balcony of her flat during an altercation on Sunday. Born Sonnyboy Sekowe, the DJ spent the night at the Sandton police station and is expected to appear at the Randburg magistrate’s court on Monday. He faces a charge of gender-based violence (GBV) for assaulting the actress, who is also his girlfriend. The 29-year-old former TV presenter told the police that she had a squabble with the Ba Straata hitmaker after confronting him about an argument at a gig on Saturday night. She said in a statement: “I confronted him so that we can talk about our argument, which happened the previous night during his gig.” The actress said the acclaimed music producer responded aggressively and started slapping her on the face. “He held me, took me to the balcony, and grabbed me aggressively by my neck,” Phongolo, who once starred in Generations: The Legacy as Namhla Diale, said. The actress’ management team said she was with her road manager when she went to the police station to open a case of assault. “We are still trying to gather how she is doing. I am seeing her in the next hour … We just need to actually figure out what is happening … She was with her road manager,” said Phongolo’s manager. Maphorisa, who is also known as Phori, was allegedly arrested during the day after the Sandton police showed up at his house. A source close to the case said the muso tried to get bail on the spot, but was denied. “He is facing a serious charge of assault GBV and he can only get bail in court for that, so he has to stay behind bars overnight before he can get bail,” said the source. Phongolo and Maphorisa have been dating on and off for close to two years. Gauteng police spokesperson Mavela Masondo could not confirm that a case of assault has been opened at the time of publishing. @Sunday World",

                "content": "It’s hard to pinpoint the last time a game made me feel the same way that Journey did. After Us comes close to replicating that feeling in its environment, how it moves, and how it made me feel. But it also sets itself apart where it matters. After Us is an explorative puzzle platformer developed by the Barcelona-based Piccolo Studio and published by Private Division. You play Gaia, a young spirit tasked with bringing life back to a world with little left to give. That is, of course, except for the various now-extinct animals from whom Gaia must gather life force. We were given the chance to give a preview build of After Us , and from the hour-and-a-half I’ve played so far, I’m pretty comfortable in saying that it’s got the potential to be something truly special. Your journey begins in a lush forest filled with fauna, as you awaken and take in your surroundings in. And then suddenly, everything starts to fade as an sourceless, omnipotent voice tells you know that it’s up to you to find all the animals that have disappeared, completely set them free, and bring their spirits back to this oasis. It is then that you are thrust into a dark and lifeless car park. The world is dead, and all that remains is vengeful trash, oil spills, abandoned vehicles, and human statues. Every step that Gaia takes is a step full of life as grass and flowers grow in her path, and bursts of life save her from imminent danger. You are the natural world’s last hope. The message of environmentalism in After Us is set up to be a tearjerker. Our protagonist is shown to have an emotional reaction to the decaying world around her, and a negative one at that. If the first hour and a half are enough to make me wobbly here, I don’t know what I’m going to do with the full game. I’m a freakin’ sook! As After Us seems to be a platformer at its core, it would only make sense for moving around and getting from one point to another to feel as good as possible. As a spirit, moving around and jumping feels incredibly fluid once you get the hang of it. The double jumping, the air-dashing, the zipping down power lines, and the zooming up walls felt fantastic. As well, a ring appears below Gaia to signify where she’ll land, which is perfect for a platformer like this. And then there’s the collection of animal spirits. In each area you’ve got a handful of little spirits as well as one big great one. The little spirits exist as shining little lights around each map, and you can make Gaia sing a little song to guide her towards the nearest spirits. It almost felt melancholic in a way, as there’s no possibility for call and response and yet an inkling of the animal’s spirit lives on just enough to signal where it’s hiding. Once you collect a spirit, the game lets you know which animal that spirit represents. Afterwards, you’ll end up finding said animal spirit all around the map, with the game giving you the option to greet or pet the animal. As we all know, being able to pet an animal in a video game is a huge bonus, and After Us seems to be well aware of that. And then I found the giant sausage dog surrounded by trash. Folks, I felt SICK . I was so sad. These are the big spirits, who are simply holding onto that last piece of life and are waiting for you to help free their souls. For a world so desolate, this was an opportunity for the game to represent its message of giving life a second chance in quite the moving way. Watching the dachshund soul leap from its body was truly something else. It makes sense that After Us aims for your heartstrings and gives them a tug, considering its creators are also responsible for the critically-acclaimed tearjerker Arise: A Simple Story . Piccolo Studio clearly know how to tell a story in a way that really grabs the player, and I really felt that in even the short time that I’ve had with After Us so far. Even though this is only a preview build, I’m personally very excited with what After Us has to offer so far. With its smooth traversal mechanics, visually spectacular worlds that tell their own stories purely in their visage, and its story of life, death, and rebirth, I’ve not no plans to put this one down any time soon.",

A post shared by Syeda Madiha Imam (@madihaimam) “After some time when it ended and everyone came back, they were like ‘You are still here?’,” she quipped flaunting her professionalism. At another point, Imam recalled a funny fan encounter who had dropped flowers for her in the hospital where her father was admitted after meeting with an incident. “My father thought that we have brought flowers for him, so I didn’t tell him the truth,” Imam said. Madiha Imam wipes her Instagram after marriage It is pertinent to mention that the actor recently tied the knot with Moji Basar.

    "description": "Drops by 57 places from 33 among 180 countries according to the 2023 World Press Freedom Index YANGCHEN LHAMO | ThimphuBhutan has ranked 90th in the World Press Freedom Index this year,…",
    "content": "| Bhutan has ranked 90th in the World Press Freedom Index this year, a drop from previous year’s position of 33. This is according to the 2023 World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) compiled by the France-based organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF). The score is based on political, economic, legislative, social, and security indicators. Problems such as direct appointment of members of media regulatory body by the government, difficulties in getting access to state-held information, and self-censorship by journalists in the country are some of the factors that have attributed to the drop in the ranking. The report states that the country’s daily newspaper, , which is published in both English and Dzongkha, is owned by the government while there are six private newspapers. Private newspapers emerged as a transition to democracy since 2006. The , is a state-owned lone television in the country. Bhutan’s internet is now expanding fast, with more and more news and information circulating on blogs and social media. Current media scenario in the country is that some private houses have shut down over the years. More than 80 journalists, including 20 from the print media, have quit journalism in the past year. Low salaries, poor working environment, access to information are factors that demotivated the media professionalisms. In the political context the report states that the pressure the government can exert on the media is limited by the parliamentary system, which allows a degree of pluralism to be asserted. Media professionals agreed that the elected government is more open than bureaucrats when it comes to sharing information. On the legal framework, the Bhutan Infocomm and Media Authority governs the media and information while journalists have to practice ethics regulated by the body. The report further asserts that in the Economic contextprivate media houses face sustainability issue in a difficult economic environment, with a relatively low readership and insufficient advertising. “Most ads are placed by government agencies, which account for 80% of the advertising revenue of print newspapers and most of the agencies uses social media and their own official pages for passing information and advertise. The national newspaper is given highest priority for the advertisement,” it states. Further, on the sociocultural context it states that many journalists avoid covering sensitive issues for fear of appearing to challenge the social order. However, on the safety aspects, journalists in Bhutan do not face any physical threats but, as a result of social media’s development, any reporting that may cause annoyance, can be targeted in social media platforms. Nonetheless, even with the significant drop, Bhutan’s press freedom is much better in the Asian region. In the SAARC region, Nepal ranks 95, the Maldives 100, Sri Lanka 135, Pakistan 150, Afghanistan 152, India 161, and Bangladesh 163. Norway ranked first with 95.18 points followed by Ireland and Denmark with 89.91 and 89.48 points, respectively. The index was declared on 3 May by the RSF coinciding with the World Press Freedom Day. The President of the Journalist Association of Bhutan (JAB), Rinzin Wangchuk, shared that it was expected that Bhutan’s press freedom ranking would drop by few positions since access to information was restricted by some public institutions. “But we never thought that our press ranking would drop by 57. It is really a shocking news although access to information has never been as challenging as over the last few years,” the president said. In its 21st annual South Asia Press Freedom Report 2022-2023, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) stated that the shifting media landscape coupled with the high turnover of journalists is compounded by shrinking access to information, all of which is impacting news coverage and people’s access to information. The report was launched on 3 May coinciding with the International Press Freedom Day.",

    "description": "If this happened in Moscow or Beijing, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak would condemn dictatorial Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping in Parliament while lionising the unjustly detained",
    "content": "So a King signs into law draconian police powers a few days before his £250m public coronation then the cops mass arrest peaceful protesters with placards and megaphones who oppose the monarch. If this happened in Moscow or Beijing, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak would condemn dictatorial Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping in Parliament while lionising the unjustly detained. When it takes place in Britain we witness UK Conservative Government Ministers queuing up to justify the indefensible. Deranged Tory vice chair Lee Anderson, a plastic patriot who missed England's male footballers getting to the Euro 2020 final because they took the knee against bigotry, urged anti-monarchists to emigrate. I could suggest enemies of free speech such as foot-in-mouth Anderson do the same but prefer instead to challenge the authoritarianism of Right-whinge snowflakes who'd cancel those they disagree with. Met Police bosses face grilling over 'worrying' Coronation protest clampdown The Met Police arrested 52 people on Saturday, sparking widespread criticism ( Image: Mark Thomas/REX/Shutterstock) The right to peaceful protest is precious and we'll lose it in this country unless the police state is challenged. Arresting the head of Republic, Graham Smith, and others in London was a colossal own goal by a Metropolitan Police Service acting as Buckingham Palace's PR enforcement unit. Legitimate, lawful Republic believes it had a deal on the day over where and how to demonstrate which the gung-ho cops smashed. Interestingly my Daily Mirror colleague Andy Lines, our Chief Reporter, heard a commanding police officer(he believes of Inspector rank) instruct his ranks to “arrest anyone with a megaphone for breach of the peace. We can de-arrest them later if we need to.” That would clearly cross a line, an unintentional admission no offence is being committed. An independent, swift inquiry's needed to get to the bottom of what occurred to ensure no repetition. And MPs who value free speech and freedom must hold the police and Ministers to account when Parliament returns tomorrow. But this isn't only about a force behaving badly on Saturday. It's about totalitarian powers handed to them by the Government. Banning protests undermines democracy. The Government must be held to account, including by principled Conservative MPs.

    "content": "Synopsis The BJP has gone so far as to name over 100 candidates from these two communities, with 60 seats allocated to Lingayats and 43 to Vokkaligas. In addition to representation in its potential government, the BJP has also recently ousted Muslims from the OBC reservation quota (four percent) and co-opted Vokkaligas and Lingayats into it by carving out two new reservation categories for these castes. Agencies State’s Lingayat and Vokkaliga could sway the election in either party’s favour. Their hold over the state’s politics has led to both parties trying to please these communities. Lingayats comprise 17% of the population and Vokkaligas 11%. Ahead of the May 10 Assembly elections in Karnataka, the state’s two main rivals, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) and the Congress , have been campaigning at full tilt, making promises and launching barbs, all in attempts to secure a majority in the state’s 224-seat Assembly. Crucial to this are the state’s Lingayat and Vokkaliga voters, who could sway the election in either party’s favour. Their hold over the state’s politics has led to both parties trying to please these communities. Lingayats comprise 17% of the population and Vokkaligas 11%. The BJP has gone so far as to name over 100 candidates from these two communities, with 60 seats allocated to Lingayats and 43 to Vokkaligas. In addition to representation in its potential government, the BJP has also recently ousted Muslims from the OBC reservation quota (four percent) and co-opted Vokkaligas and Lingayats into it by carving out two new reservation categories for these castes. For Vokkaligas, this will take the reservation from the existing four per cent to six per cent, and for the Lingayats, from five per cent to seven per cent. Muslim reservations have now been moved to the economically weaker sections reservation in education and jobs. In its Karnataka manifesto, the BJP has reiterated its stand of abolishing quota for Muslims in Karnataka and distributing the quota among castes from the OBC segment, a measure aimed to keep the caste equation in its favour while at the same time consolidating its Hindutva vote base. The Congress, in retaliation, has announced that reservations would be hiked to 75 percent if the party forms the government. Former chief minister Siddaramaiah has seemingly based his promises on the caste census conducted in 2015, results of which have not been released yet. Earlier in April, AICC general secretary RS Surjewala and Karnataka state Congress president DK Shivakumar attacked the ruling party, at a media conference, for first promising increase in reservation to Lingayat, Vokkaliga and SC/ST community members and later backing out in the Supreme Court. The saffron party, meanwhile, has been making consistent efforts to endear itself to the two communities. In 2020, the Karnataka government set up the Veerashaiva Lingayat Development Authority, and then, a year later it set up the Vokkaliga Development Board. When the BJP came to power in 2019, it appointed three deputy chief ministers, including one each from Vokkaliga and Lingayat communities. When BS Yediyurappa was removed as the chief minister, he was replaced with Basavaraj Bommai, another Lingayat leader. Both parties are using community-based reservations as a platform to appeal to the LIngayats and Vokkaligas. All this while, the Supreme Court has been hearing a case against the reservations announced by the Karnataka government, and has said that the government order is based on \"fallacious presumptions\". The next hearing is set for May 9, on Tuesday, which will play a huge role in deciding if the quota remains or not. Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

    "content": "The death of the most independent and charismatic U.N. Secretary General ever, Daag Hammarskjold of Sweden, remained a mystery for decades. Daag Hammarskjold was the second Secretary General of the U.N. and held the position from 1953 until his death in a mysterious plane crash in a forest near Ndola on September 18, 1961. Ndola, currently in Zambia, was then part of the British protectorate of Rhodesia. Suspicions of foul play in the crash abounded and have never died down. The enigmatic remarks of President Truman quoted in the two day later, indicate that he knew of foul play in Hammarskjold’s death. He used the phrase “they killed him”. It was Harry S. Truman who, as President, had created the CIA through the National Security Act of 1947. The British Central African Federation, headed by Sir Roy Welensky, comprised of Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, and Nyasaland - currently Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi. Welensky’s own views about the U.N. role in the then Katanga conflict in Congo were highly unfavorable towards the U.N. All Rhodesian investigations into the crash were conducted under Welensky’s government. Welensky was blamed for the death of Hammarskjold and became a hated symbol of colonialism throughout the Afro-Asian world. Welensky’s mother was an Afrikaan and his father a Lithuanian Jew. Hammarskjold had gone to the region to resolve a conflict in Congo. Katanga the mineral rich part of Congo had suddenly seceded under MoiseTshombe. Tshombe had accused the central government of communist leanings and of dictatorial policies. Congo was then headed by a popular leader named Patrice Lumumba, an African nationalist, and a pan-Africanist. Lumumba had appealed to the UN to prevent the breakup of Congo. Congo had become independent in 1960 and as a result of an election in May 1960, Lumumba became Prime Minister. As a result of Lumumba’s request Hammarskjold called a meeting of representatives of African countries on July 12, 1960 and then on the 14th of July the Security Council passed a resolution calling upon Belgium to withdraw its forces from Congo and also called upon the U.N. to send forces to help stabilize Congo until the Congolese government was able to develop its own forces. A 3,500 strong contingent from countries which had no interest in the Congo was sent within days of the resolution indicating Hammarskjold’s interest in saving Congo’s fledgling democracy. Katanga was of vital importance to the West as it was rich in copper, uranium, cobalt (which is crucial for the aircraft industry), and so on. Soon after the announcement of Katangan independence, the Belgian mining company, Union Miniere, began paying its taxes to Katanga instead of the central government. These amounted to about 70% of Katanga’s budget and enabled Tshombe to maintain a military force. The Belgians had provided a 7,000 strong military force, along with “advisors”, supplemented by white mercenaries from Belgium, Britain and South Africa. On August 9, 1960, the diamond rich province of South Kasai declared independence under a nominal leader named Albert Kalonji. This further deepened the crisis. At the time the Belgian troops were still in the country and here too, a Belgian company named Forminiere, played a role similar to Union Miniere. The central government was being deprived of revenues from its richest regions. Lumumba seemed to have lost hope in the ability of the U.N. to save Congo. He therefore requested the Soviet Union on August 15 for military help. Hearing of the arrival of the Soviets in Congo Allen Dulles sent an urgent telegram to the CIA station head in Congo, Larry Devlin, directing that the “removal [of Lumumba] must be an urgent and prime objective … this should be a high priority of our covert action.” The order of eliminating Lumumba had been approved by President Eisenhower. The CIA had entered the field and, as had now become its practice, wished to arrange the assassination of a most popular and elected leader. Susan Williams writes: “Just two months after the independence of Congo, on 5 September, there was a new, dramatic development, facilitated by the CIA in Leopoldville. On the urging of Larry Devlin and with the support of Daphne Park, an MI6 official in Leopoldville, President Kasavubu dismissed Lumumba and six other ministers – members of democratically elected government. Kasavubu’s order was firmly condemned by a joint meeting of the Congo’s upper and lower Houses of Parliament, which accorded full powers to the government of Lumumba.” CIA, however, was unrelenting. On 14 September, under the direction of the CIA, Kasavubu dissolved the Parliament. And on that very evening a 29-year old colonel, a CIA asset, named Desire Mobutu took over military control of the country. That was the end of Congo’s democracy. It had, on account of its mineral wealth, become a proxy battleground. And the U.N, was caught in the midst of it all. Then, in January 1961, Lumumba and two other ministers were killed. The whole world knew immediately that this was a CIA assassination. Proof of it is now available because of what Dulles had stated in his telegram to Larry Devin. The urgency in getting rid of Lumumba also arose from the imminent change in the White House. James W. Douglas has written in his outstanding book JFK and the Unspeakable: “The CIA took seriously Kennedy’s African nationalist sympathies. As his inauguration approached, the CIA’s station chief in Leopoldville, Lawrence Devlin, spoke of ‘the need to take “drastic steps” before it was too late.’ CIA analyst Paul Sakawa pointed out in an interview that the decision to put Lumumba in the hands of his assassins was made by men ‘in the pay of and receiving constant counsel from the CIA station.’ The CIA succeeded in having Lumumba killed in haste by Belgian collaborators three days before Kennedy took oath of office.” Kennedy learned of Lumumba’s assassination on February 13, 1961 and was “horror-stricken”. Little did he know that he too would fall prey to CIA’s bloodlust almost three years later! The outcry against the assassination of Lumumba was worldwide and the U.N. was under pressure for having failed to protect him. Hammarskjold had met Lumumba shortly before Lumumba’s assassination. The U.N. had launched Operation Morthor on September 13, 1961 to bring Katanga back to the Congolese fold. The U.N. intended to police the region and the 15,000 strong U.N. force comprised military men from eighteen countries which had no interest in Congo. The British government then urged Welensky, Prime Minister of the British Central African Republic, on September 13, to send Rhodesian troops and air force in the vicinity of the border. The Western powers had no intention of allowing the U.N. to enforce its principled decisions in regions that were of interest to them. Hammarskjold had gone to the region to meet Tshombe, who was supported by Belgian, British and South African mercenaries, so as to effect a cease-fire. In the year 1998 certain documents appear to have been found, apparently accidentally, in a file in South Africa that seemed to open a door to investigations by researchers into the death of Hammarskjold. Christelle Terreblanche, who was working for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) of South Africa was given a file pertaining to the 1993 assassination of Chris Hani, head of the South African Communist Party. In the file that Terreblanche took home, were about 12 pages related to something called Operation Celeste. This operation was not related to the assassination of Hani but to the assassination of Daag Hammarskjold. The operation involved blowing up the plane carrying Daag Hammarskjold by planting a bomb on it. The documents involved MI5, Special Operations Executive (which apparently had been disbanded after WWII) and mentioned that Allen Dulles of CIA had assured full cooperation. The documents, some handwritten, some typed carried the name of an organization called South African Institute of Maritime Research (SAIMR). According to the documents Operation Celeste did not go as planned because the bomb was to blow off at the time of take-off but instead blew up on landing. Terreblanche thought over the matter quite intensely because she was used to finding disinformation in the files. But she felt that it was a matter of great importance and that the matter needed a proper investigation. She tried to argue with her superiors but was not successful because they were in July 1998 and the TRC report had to be filed with President Nelson Mandela by October 1998. Terreblanche had had a terrible experience which seemed to involve SAIMR although she had not earlier ever heard of it. In her files a human rights claim had turned up by default. The daughter of a woman had been working on AIDs research in Mozambique for the SAIMR! She had found out that SAIMR had been smuggling contaminated vaccines into Angola and Mozambique. The daughter was planning to come and tell her mother about it when she was killed in a car hijacking incident in Johannesburg. The death could not be accidental. If SAIMR was connected with the MI5 and the CIA, as indicated in the Operation Celeste documents, then the girl might have been killed to prevent her from revealing the matter of contaminated vaccines being smuggled into Africa by SAIMR, to her mother in detail. In fact, the brother of the murdered lady told the Danish director Mads Brugger (who produced a documentary on Hammarskjold) that she had predicted that she would be killed! That indicates that she was aware of that SAIMR was indeed a lethal organization. But nobody had heard of it. On August 19, 1998, Bishop Desmond Tutu revealed the existence of documents pertaining to Operation Celeste. He released copies of eight out the twelve pages. All names had been redacted because TRC rules required that the concerned persons be contacted prior to release of their names. Tutu explained that the Celeste documents had been handed over to the Minister of Justice Dullah Omar who, at the time, had not had the time to look at the documents and did not, therefore, comment. Desmond Tutu also pointed out that the mandate of TRC was running out and TRC was, therefore, not in a position to investigate the authenticity of the documents. However, he did not rule out such an investigation in view of the serious content of the documents. Bishop Desmond Tutu’s revelations got worldwide attention. In the Belgian Senate a demand for a proper investigation was raised but it was not taken up. The British Foreign Office expectedly denied any involvement of the British government in the assassination. The CIA, as always, denied any involvement. An investigation by the Rhodesian authorities laid the blame on pilot error. But the matter was not so simple. One man who survived the crash and died six days later, revealed that the plane was already in flames before crashing. Eye witnesses also reported that the plane was in flames while in the air. Witnesses also reported seeing another plane that flew away after the crash. They also reported that after the plane crashed, the lights of the airport went dim. The notes of the air traffic controller were lost and were reconstructed two days later. All bodies of those dead were charred beyond recognition except that of Hammarskjold. A photograph showed a playing card stuffed into Hammarskjold ruffled tie. According to a witness the card was an ace of spades. The plane was discovered at 3;00 p.m., almost 15 hours later, whereas it crashed around midnight and witnesses had reported it early on. In 2000, a Norwegian historian had obtained copies of the SAIMR documents from the TRC records, through his country’s ambassador in Pretoria. The CEO of TRC faxed copies eight of the twelve pages to the ambassador on 29th May, 2000, apologizing for their poor quality, and stating that the originals had been sent to the National Intelligence Agency. Susan Williams has pointed out that the originals seem to have disappeared. Searches made in collaboration with relevant South African institutions and officers failed to produce the documents. In her book Susan Williams has looked into the possibility that these documents could be disinformation. But there are so many things about them that ring true despite some questions that arise. One document, entitled “ORDERS” has been reproduced by Susan Williams. It refers to a meeting between MI5, Special Ops and SAIMR. It starts by stating that” Dag” [i.e. Hammarskjold] has requested that blockbusters be shipped to Katanga via Rhodesia and South Africa, and that Dr. V [Hendrick Verwoerd, PM of SA] and Sir Roy [Welensky] have refused. The document then goes on: “UNO is becoming troublesome and it is felt that Dag Hammarskjold should be removed. Allen Dulles agrees and has promised full cooperation from his people. [He] tells us that Dag will be in Leopoldville on or about 12/9/61. The aircraft ferrying him will be a D.C. 6 in the livery of ‘TRANSAIR,’ a Swedish Company.” The next part of the said document contains orders to eliminate Daag Hammarskjold: “Please see that Leo airport as well as Elizabethville is covered by your people as I want his removal to be handled more efficiently than was Patrice [Lumumba]. If time permits, send me a brief plan of action, otherwise proceed in all speed in absolute secrecy. If McKeown and O’Brein can be dealt with simultaneously it would be useful but not if it could compromise the main operation. If, and only if serious complications arise tell your agents to use telephone [illegible’ Johannesburg 25-3512. Operation to be known as Operation Celeste.” Lt. Gen. Sean McKeown was from Ireland and headed the UNO forces. Connor Cruise O’Brein was an official of the UNO. In a communication from a “Commandant” it is suggested. to focus only on Daag Hammarskjold. It also states: “Dag will be sorted out on the 17th or 18th “ (he has an appointment in Ndola on the 18th or 19th) all my men as well as Congo Red’s people are in In position.” The SAIMR documents contain a document entitled Report Operation Celeste dated 18.9.61. The operation involved pacing a six pound TNT bomb in the carriage of the plane which would explode when the wheels of the pane were retracted after take-off. A document dated 18.1.61 and entitled “Report Operation Celeste” states: “1. Device failed on take-off. 2. Despatched Eagle [illegible word] to follow and take [illegible words] 3. Device activated [illegible words] prior to landing. 4. As advised McKeown and O’Brein were not on board. 5. Mission accomplished satisfactory. Message Ends”. An American intelligence officer named Charles Southall was posted in Nicosia, Cyprus, at the time of the Daag Hammarskjold’s plane crash. He worked for the NSA. The NSA had a listening post in Cyprus, which was located in a huge hall, with equipment and about one hundred desks, just outside Nicosia. Southall was in charge of a team that processed incoming messages. If possible they decrypted them, or translated them and sent the reports to Washington, along with relevant information about their source and time, etc. Southall revealed something about the Hammarskjold assassination, which he also confirmed in an interview with Susan Williams. About three hours before midnight on September 17, 1961, he got a call from the Communications Watch Officer: “Hey! Get yourself out here tonight! Something interesting is going to happen.” So some of the NSA people were aware of an impending assassination. Intrigued, Southall changed and drove over. About four or five people clustered around a loudspeaker and heard a recording that was about seven or eight minutes old. The time was shortly after midnight. They could hear the noise of an engine and the voice of a pilot who was stating what he was seeing and doing. “I see a transport plane coming low. All the lights are on. I’m going down to make a run on it. Yes it is the Transair DC6. It’s the plane.” Then they heard the gun cannons firing. The pilot then exclaimed: “I’ve hit it. There are flames. It’s going down. It’s crashing.” Charles Southall’s revelation confirms what witnesses saw and reported viz. there was another plane, and the DC6 was in flames while in the air. From the documents, and from an assessment of the situation, it is clear that Western powers wished to eliminate Daag Hammarskjold. The elimination of Daag Hammarskjold did not, and could not have had the approval of President Kennedy. So why did Allen Dulles, who was to leave as Director Central Intelligence at the end of 1961, give a go ahead for the assassination of Daag Hammarskjold? In doing so Dulles was doing something over and above the head of his president. Dulles had been “removed”, by a premature termination of his tenure, by John Kennedy for having lied to him in regard to the Bay of Pigs operation. This question of why Dulles wished that Hammarskjold be assassinated, has finally been answered by Dr. Greg Poulgrain in his 2020 book . A dispute was going on in the Far East at the time regarding the ownership of the Netherlands New Guinea area (also called Papua). The dispute involved Netherlands, a NATO member and Indonesia, an emerging developing country. What was known to a tiny circle of the Dutch government, and to Allen Dulles, but was not known to Sukarno, was the quiet discovery of huge gold deposits in the dense mountains of Netherlands New Guinea in 1936. The discovery was made by, what was thought to be a Dutch company, NNGPM (it is an acronym of a Dutch name). It was not known that the Rockefellers had 60% ownership of company and Allen Dulles, as their legal representative, had helped set up NNGPM in 1935. So Dulles knew of the immense gold wealth of the region. In the words of Poulgrain: “In the alpine regions of Neterlands New Guinea in 1936, three Dutchmen discovered a mountainous outcrop of ore with high copper content and very high concentrations of gold. When later analyzed in Netherlands, the gold (in grams per ton) proved to be twice that of Witwatersrand in in South Africa, then the world’s richest goldmine, but this information was not made public. If the real concentration of the gold discovery had been announced, Dutch sovereignty of the remote territory would have become even more precarious than the slim hold it had, with only a few hundred Dutch people living there.” In view of this the results of geological analysis of the place (Erstberg mountain) were hugely falsified in geological publications in 1939. Poulgarin writes: “Written incorrectly in the summary of the results, the gold concentration was stated to be only one-fifteenth of the actual gold concentration, and this created the false impression that the Erstberg was not worth consideration as a gold mine.” Dulles was a 32nd degree Freemason and was a loyal dog of the Rockefellers. He wanted his masters, the Rockefellers, to own that gold. At the time the CIA had not been established. When Dulles became Director CIA he did not reveal the existence of the gold to either Eisenhower or JFK. He knew that under Sukarno the Rockefellers could never own the Erstburg gold. He therefore pursued his own secret policy in Indonesia. As a first step he wished that Sukarno be eliminated. The CIA organized assassination attempts but Sukarno survived, escaping so narrowly on one occasion, when his security in charge pushed him to the ground and covered him with his own body. JFK wished to win over Indonesia but had the problem that if he preferred Indonesia over a NATO ally it could be embarrassing. However, according to Poulgrain: “His [Hammarskjold’s] plan was to annul all claims of sovereignty other than the indigenous inhabitants and to announce this at the UN General Assembly in October/November 1961, but his death occurred in September 1961.” Daag Hammarskjold had worked out a solution for regions which were becoming independent but had no experience whatsoever in governance. That plan, called OPEX, would have led to an independent Netherlands New Guinea whose administration would, for a time be run by UN officials who would train the local populace, i.e. the Papuans, to administer their country. Poulgrain writes: “Applying OPEX to the New Guinea dispute. Hammarskjold was threatening to take the territory out of the control of all aspiring colonial powers and out of the hands of Rockefeller Oil that had first staked its claim before World War II. The motive to prevent him from implementing OPEX in West New Guinea, quite apart from the Sino-Soviet bloc opposition, was immense.” As pointed out by authors the UN activities were “vigorously scrutinized by the CIA “in New York. Dulles was, therefore, aware of what was going on with regard to OPEX and he knew that JFK supported Daag Hammarskjold’s initiative. Dulles also knew that once the OPEX plan was announced in the UN General Assembly, JFK would openly support it. And that was what he wished to stop at all costs. In the worlds of Poulgrain: “While Belgian and British interests were more directly tied to the Katanga dispute, Dulles was seen more as a Cold War participant and slightly removed from direct involvement. Dulles’ motive to stop Hammarskjold from interfering in the New Guinea dispute was far greater than any apparent motive in Congo. He was so far ahead of his contemporaries they did not suspect him of pushing a button, or causing a death, on one side of the world to benefit a covert strategy of his on the other side of the world.” In a separate article it will be described how Dulles, and then his man Richard Helms as Director CIA, precipitated a civil war in Indonesia and eventually managed to get hold of the Erstburg gold for a company in which the Rockefellers had an important share. The of the JFK assassination was also tied up with the Netherlands New Guinea gold. JFK was to visit Indonesia in January 1964, and he was killed weeks before that visit, on November 23, 1963.Had JFK visited Indonesia Sukarno would have stayed on as a lifetime President, and the gold would never have gone the way Dulles desired.",

"content": "NASA launched two small satellites designed to track tropical cyclones hour by hour from a base in New Zealand on Monday, in a project that could improve weather predictions on devastating storms. The new storm trackers, sent into orbit on a rocket built by US company Rocket Lab, can fly over hurricanes (or typhoons in the Pacific) every hour, compared to every six hours with current satellites. Researchers will be able to see storms evolve on an hourly basis, said NASA scientist Will McCarty at a press conference for the first launch of the TROPICS mission. \"We still need the large satellites,\" he added. \"What we get from this is the ability to add more information to the flagship satellites that we already have.\" A second Rocket Lab-built vessel is due to launch in about two weeks carrying two more satellites to complete a small constellation of four storm-tracking satellites. READ | EXPLAINER | Are storms getting more powerful and dangerous? The information gathered on rainfall, temperature and humidity could help scientists determine where a hurricane will make landfall and how intense it will be, helping people living in coastal areas be better prepared for possible evacuations. \"Many operational organisations like the National Hurricane Center and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and many others are ready to receive tropical imagery to help inform their forecasters,\" said Ben Kim, a program executive at NASA. In the long term, a better understanding of the formation and evolution of these storms could help improve climate models. The constellation was originally intended to have six satellites, not four, but the first two were lost when a US Astra rocket malfunctioned shortly after lift-off last year. Hurricanes, or typhoons, are becoming more powerful as the ocean surface warms, scientists say. Hurricane Ian, which devastated Florida in 2022, killed dozens of people and caused more than $100 billion in damage, making it by far the world's most expensive weather disaster of the year.",

"content": "eBusiness Weekly Government has procured all the equipment needed to roll out an electronic mining title management system (the cadastre system), with the process now expected to gather momentum. A mining cadastre system is a computer-based and up-to-date land information system containing a record of interests in land, such as land owners’ rights, restrictions and responsibilities. Once data on mining rights and title is fully computerised, the system is expected to enhance transparency and accountability in the administration of mining claims. So far, the Government has operationalised the system in Manicaland Province. The roll-out is now targeting Mashonaland East and Mashonaland West provinces, before spreading to the rest of the mining regions. Metal stakes or concrete beacons were previously used to demarcate claims and rights. This, however, created disputes over mining title ownership, particularly by small-scale miners. Mines and Mining Development Deputy Minister Polite Kambamura told The Sunday Mail that the new system is likely to eliminate disputes in the sector. “We are in the implementation stage to have the system rolled out to all the provinces. The servers and all other resources needed for the system are available. Currently, our technical people are implementing it province by province. So far, we have finished Manicaland and we are working on other provinces – Mashonaland East and Mashonaland West,” he said. Transparency in the administration of mining claims is also envisaged to attract new investment into the sector. Zimbabwe is endowed with vast minerals resources that include gold, platinum, diamond, chrome, lithium, tantalite, tantalum and coal, among others. “It’s a bit difficult to give a timeframe as to when we will be done with rolling out of the cadastre system because there are some other unexpected challenges beyond our control, like power challenges. “Otherwise the good thing is its work in progress and everything is now in place,” added Deputy Minister Kambamura. “It (the cadastre system) reduces disputes and also the time taken to peg a mine because the old system was using old maps, and there were a lot of duplications on the old maps. “So, now it is a matter of transferring data from the old maps to the computerised system … also this system cannot be easily manipulated because it eliminates human interference as much as possible.” Early last year, the Government reduced the backlog for mining title applications that had ballooned to 20 000 by more than half. Currently, mining accounts for more than 75 percent of foreign direct investment, 83 percent of exports, 19 percent of Government revenues, 2 percent of formal employment and 11 percent of individual incomes.",

"description": "It's not just your gas stove the Biden administration is seeking to regulate in the name of combating climate change - they're coming for your entire home.",
"content": "Print By Susan Ferrechio - The Washington Times - Sunday, May 7, 2023 It’s not just your gas stove the Biden administration is seeking to regulate in the name of combating climate change – they’re coming for your entire home. President Biden’s green energy goals have prompted a new array of efficiency rules for a slew of household appliances from microwaves to toothbrush chargers. The effort is forcing manufacturers to produce more costly products they say reverse innovation by decades and potentially eliminate thousands of U.S. jobs. Biden administration officials are touting the new rules as part of the goal to take 100 actions “to strengthen energy efficiency standards for a range of appliances and equipment to lower costs for American families.” Combined, the plethora of new rules would save the average family $100 annually in lower energy bills. But industry leaders say the new rules come with steep up-front costs for consumers and negatively impact performance. Rather than innovating new features sought by consumers, the ramped-up regulations for appliances are forcing manufacturers to go backward, said Jill Notini, a spokeswoman for the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers “They are literally going to have to redesign products that will look closer to the 1950s than they do to 2020,” Ms. Notini said. The association and manufacturers have been working with the Energy Department to try to moderate the onslaught of new rules. But they are not making much progress, which manufacturers say breaks from a long tradition of manufacturers and administration officials working together on energy efficiency rules. Manufacturers also say it is overwhelming them with higher production costs and, in some cases, difficulty meeting the new standards. One industry executive described the cascade of regulations as “an avalanche” and “unprecedented” in stringency and scope. The Department of Energy late last week quietly added yet another new rule that will force manufacturers to redesign appliances, introducing new proposed standards that will require dishwashers to cut water use, some by more than one-third, and reduce energy consumption by up to 27% for some models. The proposed rules are even more drastic for washing machines. The standards proposed by the Energy Department would eliminate 98% of all top-loading washing machines on the market today and would require manufacturers to make machines larger and remove the central agitator that increases cleaning performance. One manufacturer said the new efficiency standard would add $200 to the cost of a top-loading machine. An accompanying rule for clothes dryers would end the sale of less expensive models that do not comply with strict federal Energy Star efficiency standards. Manufacturers are also grappling with new energy rules for microwave ovens that would reduce power usage in standby mode. To meet the new caps, manufacturers say they may eliminate backlighting and display clocks that remain lit while the microwave is not in use, as well as some higher-end sensors that improve performance. The Energy Department is also ramping up efficiency standards for refrigerators, requiring more expensive compressors and insulation components that will raise costs and possibly reduce interior space. New efficiency rules are also coming for appliance chargers, air conditioners, air purifiers and gas stoves. The Biden administration’s plan to increase the energy efficiency of gas stoves has received the lion’s share of public attention and outcry from manufacturers who say it will make it impossible to produce some of the more popular gas stove models and will increase cooking time significantly because burner size would have to shrink. Industry insiders accuse the Department of Energy of ignoring manufacturer data on cost and performance and not backing down on the stringency or the swift pace of the new regulations as they work to meet President Biden’s aggressive plan to reduce emissions and combat climate change. The administration is also rushing to comply with a lawsuit it settled with environmental groups over missed deadlines for updating energy efficiency standards during the Trump administration, though the deadline does not require stricter standards. Most of the new rules will be finalized by next year, which will give manufacturers until 2027 to comply with all of them. A top executive at one of the nation’s leading manufacturers, who requested anonymity to speak freely about the new rules, said appliance makers are overwhelmed by the onslaught of new requirements impacting ten different product categories. “We’ve never had that many rules with compliance dates at the same time,” he said. “And the magnitude of the standards are very stringent. Something we haven’t seen before.” A spokesman for the Department of Energy pointed to a recent Morning Consult poll showing 59% of adults back stronger efficiency standards for appliances and buildings, including 48% who identified as Republicans. The spokesman said one manufacturer, Samsung, expressed support for the new efficiency standards for refrigerators and washing machines. “The Department is required by Congress to review appliance energy conservation standards and determine whether to amend such standards,” a department spokesman said. “As such, DOE will continue to build on our decades-long partnership with industry partners and stakeholders to improve the efficiency of household appliances and provide more Americans the opportunity to save on their utility bills, all without sacrificing the reliability and performance that consumers have come to expect and rely on.” Energy savings for individual consumers would be small. The new washing machine rules would save less than $8 annually and the new clothes dryer efficiency standards would save $36 per year, according to the Energy Department. In exchange for the energy savings, clothes would take much longer to dry, increasing the potential for fabric damage, warned Whirlpool executives in a letter to the Energy Department. The washing machine savings, they said, would come with longer cycle times, more noise and vibration, an increase in tangled clothes and less effective cleaning due to lower water and temperature allowances. The up-front cost increases for appliances to meet the new standards will also impact lower-income consumers the most, manufacturers said, because they target lower-priced items that are less energy-efficient, such as refrigerators with freezers on top, which make up about 50% of the refrigerator market. Top-loading washers are typically less expensive than the more energy-efficient, front-loading machines which are rebounding in popularity, while ower-cost dryers that do not meet Energy Star requirements would be pushed out of the market entirely. Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, which is in favor of the new rules, said the energy cost savings might seem small, but they will add up. “Standards can be particularly beneficial for saving money for low-income households,” Mr. DeLaski said, pointing to the proposed refrigerator rules as an example. “According to the DOE, most low-income households have a refrigerator with a freezer on top. Of the low-income households with this type of refrigerator, DOE estimates that 75% are renters, meaning that they don’t incur the cost of purchasing a refrigerator and yet most of the time they accrue the electricity bill savings.” The Biden administration also calculates the financial savings as a whole for everyone who buys the new appliances and they promote the total energy savings for the entire nation. In addition to household appliances, the administration is increasing energy efficiency standards on dozens of other items, including light bulbs, gas furnaces, water heaters and industrial equipment. The projected consumer savings, officials said, would be $570 billion cumulatively. Once finalized, Biden officials said in a statement, the new rules will cut greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 2.4 billion metric tons, “equivalent to the carbon emissions from 10 million homes, 17 million gas cars or 21 coal-fired power plants over 30 years.” Buried in the Energy Department’s analysis are troubling figures for the nation’s manufacturing sector. The department has calculated the new rules for washers, dryers and refrigerators alone could cumulatively cost the manufacturing industry more than 16,000 U.S. jobs if manufacturers choose to move to countries with cheaper labor to mitigate production cost increases. They also crunch numbers to show jobs could increase here due to the new rules if manufacturers stay put. Manufacturers don’t want to make that choice and are not giving up on a compromise. They continue to urge Energy Department officials to work out less stringent standards on the rules that are still under consideration, including washing machines, dryers and refrigerators. The talks may include environmental groups who are pressuring the department to maintain stricter standards. “What we’re trying to do is pull them back and say we’re trying to find something reasonable here that doesn’t really hurt consumers, that doesn’t really have those negative impacts on cost and utility,” the manufacturing insider said. “We are trying to get them to the table to have discussions about that, and we might work with other stakeholders as well to try to come to a more reasonable compromise here.” • Susan Ferrechio can be reached at sferrechio@washingtontimes.com .

Thirty-nine-year-old Darren McKeown from Hillside Crescent, Moy, was fined a total of £450 with a £15 offender's levy and given six penalty points for failing to stop at the scene of the damage-only accident, failing to remain and report the incident. Prosecuting counsel said at approximately 9.50pm on August 31 last year, police received a report of a car crashing into bollards at Charlemont Street, Moy. It was located at the side of a shop with its air bags deployed, hazard lights on and there was considerable damage to the front of the vehicle. Advertisement Advertisement The lawyer said the last registered owner of the vehicle was McKeown but when police called at his address he was not there. Later they located him walking on Dungannon Road, Moy, and he told police he did not report the incident as he was the only driver involved, she continued.

    "content": "NASA launched two small satellites designed to track tropical cyclones hour by hour from a base in New Zealand on Monday, in a project that could improve weather predictions on devastating storms. The new storm trackers, sent into orbit on a rocket built by US company Rocket Lab, can fly over hurricanes (or typhoons in the Pacific) every hour, compared to every six hours with current satellites. Researchers will be able to see storms evolve on an hourly basis, said NASA scientist Will McCarty at a press conference for the first launch of the TROPICS mission. \"We still need the large satellites,\" he added. \"What we get from this is the ability to add more information to the flagship satellites that we already have.\" A second Rocket Lab-built vessel is due to launch in about two weeks carrying two more satellites to complete a small constellation of four storm-tracking satellites. READ | EXPLAINER | Are storms getting more powerful and dangerous? The information gathered on rainfall, temperature and humidity could help scientists determine where a hurricane will make landfall and how intense it will be, helping people living in coastal areas be better prepared for possible evacuations. \"Many operational organisations like the National Hurricane Center and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and many others are ready to receive tropical imagery to help inform their forecasters,\" said Ben Kim, a program executive at NASA. In the long term, a better understanding of the formation and evolution of these storms could help improve climate models. The constellation was originally intended to have six satellites, not four, but the first two were lost when a US Astra rocket malfunctioned shortly after lift-off last year. Hurricanes, or typhoons, are becoming more powerful as the ocean surface warms, scientists say. Hurricane Ian, which devastated Florida in 2022, killed dozens of people and caused more than $100 billion in damage, making it by far the world's most expensive weather disaster of the year.",

    "content": "eBusiness Weekly Government has procured all the equipment needed to roll out an electronic mining title management system (the cadastre system), with the process now expected to gather momentum. A mining cadastre system is a computer-based and up-to-date land information system containing a record of interests in land, such as land owners’ rights, restrictions and responsibilities. Once data on mining rights and title is fully computerised, the system is expected to enhance transparency and accountability in the administration of mining claims. So far, the Government has operationalised the system in Manicaland Province. The roll-out is now targeting Mashonaland East and Mashonaland West provinces, before spreading to the rest of the mining regions. Metal stakes or concrete beacons were previously used to demarcate claims and rights. This, however, created disputes over mining title ownership, particularly by small-scale miners. Mines and Mining Development Deputy Minister Polite Kambamura told The Sunday Mail that the new system is likely to eliminate disputes in the sector. “We are in the implementation stage to have the system rolled out to all the provinces. The servers and all other resources needed for the system are available. Currently, our technical people are implementing it province by province. So far, we have finished Manicaland and we are working on other provinces – Mashonaland East and Mashonaland West,” he said. Transparency in the administration of mining claims is also envisaged to attract new investment into the sector. Zimbabwe is endowed with vast minerals resources that include gold, platinum, diamond, chrome, lithium, tantalite, tantalum and coal, among others. “It’s a bit difficult to give a timeframe as to when we will be done with rolling out of the cadastre system because there are some other unexpected challenges beyond our control, like power challenges. “Otherwise the good thing is its work in progress and everything is now in place,” added Deputy Minister Kambamura. “It (the cadastre system) reduces disputes and also the time taken to peg a mine because the old system was using old maps, and there were a lot of duplications on the old maps. “So, now it is a matter of transferring data from the old maps to the computerised system … also this system cannot be easily manipulated because it eliminates human interference as much as possible.” Early last year, the Government reduced the backlog for mining title applications that had ballooned to 20 000 by more than half. Currently, mining accounts for more than 75 percent of foreign direct investment, 83 percent of exports, 19 percent of Government revenues, 2 percent of formal employment and 11 percent of individual incomes.",

    "description": "It's not just your gas stove the Biden administration is seeking to regulate in the name of combating climate change - they're coming for your entire home.",
    "content": "Print By Susan Ferrechio - The Washington Times - Sunday, May 7, 2023 It’s not just your gas stove the Biden administration is seeking to regulate in the name of combating climate change – they’re coming for your entire home. President Biden’s green energy goals have prompted a new array of efficiency rules for a slew of household appliances from microwaves to toothbrush chargers. The effort is forcing manufacturers to produce more costly products they say reverse innovation by decades and potentially eliminate thousands of U.S. jobs. Biden administration officials are touting the new rules as part of the goal to take 100 actions “to strengthen energy efficiency standards for a range of appliances and equipment to lower costs for American families.” Combined, the plethora of new rules would save the average family $100 annually in lower energy bills. But industry leaders say the new rules come with steep up-front costs for consumers and negatively impact performance. Rather than innovating new features sought by consumers, the ramped-up regulations for appliances are forcing manufacturers to go backward, said Jill Notini, a spokeswoman for the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers “They are literally going to have to redesign products that will look closer to the 1950s than they do to 2020,” Ms. Notini said. The association and manufacturers have been working with the Energy Department to try to moderate the onslaught of new rules. But they are not making much progress, which manufacturers say breaks from a long tradition of manufacturers and administration officials working together on energy efficiency rules. Manufacturers also say it is overwhelming them with higher production costs and, in some cases, difficulty meeting the new standards. One industry executive described the cascade of regulations as “an avalanche” and “unprecedented” in stringency and scope. The Department of Energy late last week quietly added yet another new rule that will force manufacturers to redesign appliances, introducing new proposed standards that will require dishwashers to cut water use, some by more than one-third, and reduce energy consumption by up to 27% for some models. The proposed rules are even more drastic for washing machines. The standards proposed by the Energy Department would eliminate 98% of all top-loading washing machines on the market today and would require manufacturers to make machines larger and remove the central agitator that increases cleaning performance. One manufacturer said the new efficiency standard would add $200 to the cost of a top-loading machine. An accompanying rule for clothes dryers would end the sale of less expensive models that do not comply with strict federal Energy Star efficiency standards. Manufacturers are also grappling with new energy rules for microwave ovens that would reduce power usage in standby mode. To meet the new caps, manufacturers say they may eliminate backlighting and display clocks that remain lit while the microwave is not in use, as well as some higher-end sensors that improve performance. The Energy Department is also ramping up efficiency standards for refrigerators, requiring more expensive compressors and insulation components that will raise costs and possibly reduce interior space. New efficiency rules are also coming for appliance chargers, air conditioners, air purifiers and gas stoves. The Biden administration’s plan to increase the energy efficiency of gas stoves has received the lion’s share of public attention and outcry from manufacturers who say it will make it impossible to produce some of the more popular gas stove models and will increase cooking time significantly because burner size would have to shrink. Industry insiders accuse the Department of Energy of ignoring manufacturer data on cost and performance and not backing down on the stringency or the swift pace of the new regulations as they work to meet President Biden’s aggressive plan to reduce emissions and combat climate change. The administration is also rushing to comply with a lawsuit it settled with environmental groups over missed deadlines for updating energy efficiency standards during the Trump administration, though the deadline does not require stricter standards. Most of the new rules will be finalized by next year, which will give manufacturers until 2027 to comply with all of them. A top executive at one of the nation’s leading manufacturers, who requested anonymity to speak freely about the new rules, said appliance makers are overwhelmed by the onslaught of new requirements impacting ten different product categories. “We’ve never had that many rules with compliance dates at the same time,” he said. “And the magnitude of the standards are very stringent. Something we haven’t seen before.” A spokesman for the Department of Energy pointed to a recent Morning Consult poll showing 59% of adults back stronger efficiency standards for appliances and buildings, including 48% who identified as Republicans. The spokesman said one manufacturer, Samsung, expressed support for the new efficiency standards for refrigerators and washing machines. “The Department is required by Congress to review appliance energy conservation standards and determine whether to amend such standards,” a department spokesman said. “As such, DOE will continue to build on our decades-long partnership with industry partners and stakeholders to improve the efficiency of household appliances and provide more Americans the opportunity to save on their utility bills, all without sacrificing the reliability and performance that consumers have come to expect and rely on.” Energy savings for individual consumers would be small. The new washing machine rules would save less than $8 annually and the new clothes dryer efficiency standards would save $36 per year, according to the Energy Department. In exchange for the energy savings, clothes would take much longer to dry, increasing the potential for fabric damage, warned Whirlpool executives in a letter to the Energy Department. The washing machine savings, they said, would come with longer cycle times, more noise and vibration, an increase in tangled clothes and less effective cleaning due to lower water and temperature allowances. The up-front cost increases for appliances to meet the new standards will also impact lower-income consumers the most, manufacturers said, because they target lower-priced items that are less energy-efficient, such as refrigerators with freezers on top, which make up about 50% of the refrigerator market. Top-loading washers are typically less expensive than the more energy-efficient, front-loading machines which are rebounding in popularity, while ower-cost dryers that do not meet Energy Star requirements would be pushed out of the market entirely. Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, which is in favor of the new rules, said the energy cost savings might seem small, but they will add up. “Standards can be particularly beneficial for saving money for low-income households,” Mr. DeLaski said, pointing to the proposed refrigerator rules as an example. “According to the DOE, most low-income households have a refrigerator with a freezer on top. Of the low-income households with this type of refrigerator, DOE estimates that 75% are renters, meaning that they don’t incur the cost of purchasing a refrigerator and yet most of the time they accrue the electricity bill savings.” The Biden administration also calculates the financial savings as a whole for everyone who buys the new appliances and they promote the total energy savings for the entire nation. In addition to household appliances, the administration is increasing energy efficiency standards on dozens of other items, including light bulbs, gas furnaces, water heaters and industrial equipment. The projected consumer savings, officials said, would be $570 billion cumulatively. Once finalized, Biden officials said in a statement, the new rules will cut greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 2.4 billion metric tons, “equivalent to the carbon emissions from 10 million homes, 17 million gas cars or 21 coal-fired power plants over 30 years.” Buried in the Energy Department’s analysis are troubling figures for the nation’s manufacturing sector. The department has calculated the new rules for washers, dryers and refrigerators alone could cumulatively cost the manufacturing industry more than 16,000 U.S. jobs if manufacturers choose to move to countries with cheaper labor to mitigate production cost increases. They also crunch numbers to show jobs could increase here due to the new rules if manufacturers stay put. Manufacturers don’t want to make that choice and are not giving up on a compromise. They continue to urge Energy Department officials to work out less stringent standards on the rules that are still under consideration, including washing machines, dryers and refrigerators. The talks may include environmental groups who are pressuring the department to maintain stricter standards. “What we’re trying to do is pull them back and say we’re trying to find something reasonable here that doesn’t really hurt consumers, that doesn’t really have those negative impacts on cost and utility,” the manufacturing insider said. “We are trying to get them to the table to have discussions about that, and we might work with other stakeholders as well to try to come to a more reasonable compromise here.” • Susan Ferrechio can be reached at sferrechio@washingtontimes.com .

Thirty-nine-year-old Darren McKeown from Hillside Crescent, Moy, was fined a total of £450 with a £15 offender's levy and given six penalty points for failing to stop at the scene of the damage-only accident, failing to remain and report the incident. Prosecuting counsel said at approximately 9.50pm on August 31 last year, police received a report of a car crashing into bollards at Charlemont Street, Moy. It was located at the side of a shop with its air bags deployed, hazard lights on and there was considerable damage to the front of the vehicle. Advertisement Advertisement The lawyer said the last registered owner of the vehicle was McKeown but when police called at his address he was not there. Later they located him walking on Dungannon Road, Moy, and he told police he did not report the incident as he was the only driver involved, she continued. Advertisement Advertisement Counsel said McKeown informed police he swerved to avoid a dog which had caused the collision. She added the defendant told police he did not think he had to report the incident as he was the only driver involved. Defence solicitor Jarlath Faloon pleaded with the court to give the defendant maximum credit for entering a plea at the earliest opportunity.

        "description": "Today, May 8th, marks World Thalassemia Day, a day dedicated to raising awareness about thalassemia, a genetic blood disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. This year’s theme is “Strengthening Education to Bridge the Thalassaemia Care Gap”. The objective of the theme is to improve the knowledge and skills of individuals impacted by thalassemia, with the aim of reducing the disparity in thalassemia treatment. Thalassemia is a genetic blood disorder that affects the body’s ability to produce hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body’s tissues. People with thalassemia produce fewer healthy red blood cells and may experience symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and anemia. In severe cases, thalassemia can lead to organ damage, heart failure, and even death. According to a report approximately 100,000 patients are suffering from Thalassemia in Pakistan and every year 5,000 babies are born with this deadly disease. The disorder is most common in the Mediterranean region, Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. As per World Health Organization (WHO), thalassemia is prevalent in many parts of the world, with an estimated 270 million carriers worldwide. On World Thalassemia Day, organizations and individuals around the world are coming together to raise awareness about the disorder and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. In many parts of the world, thalassemia is still not well understood, and patients may face stigma and discrimination due to their condition. History The Thalassaemia International Federation (TIF) established and organized the first World Thalassaemia Day in 1994, to bring global attention to the condition and its impact on individuals, families, and communities. The TIF was founded by Mr Panos Englezos, Thalassaemia patients, and their parents from the UK, USA, Greece, Italy, and Cyprus in 1986. The day was created in memory of Mr Panos’ son, George, who had passed away due to Thalassaemia. Through various initiatives and events, the day aims to encourage early screening and detection, improve access to care and treatment, and support the needs and rights of those living with thalassemia.",

Explore the SHOP Biotin supplements for hair are everywhere. Consumers have been promised that biotin is the key to strong nails and healthy strands. But that’s truly only the case if you’re biotin deficient—which is very rare. Plus, ingesting too much biotin can cause acne, rashes, and can even mess with important lab test results. “Cases of biotin deficiency as a contributing factor to hair loss and nail problems are actually very low,” says Jeffrey Fromowitz, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in Boca-Raton Florida. Caren Campbell, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in Northern California, adds that “most Westerners consume plenty of biotin in their diet. Biotin-rich foods include organ meats, eggs, fish, sweet potatoes, and almonds.” Biotin supplements can cause lab abnormalities that interfere with results, so taking them when you don’t need to isn’t a good idea. For example, they can make the test for troponin, a blood protein that is high after a heart attack, appear low, leading to a misdiagnosis. “Additionally, it can cause lab abnormalities with thyroid tests, pregnancy tests, hormone levels, and blood tests for cancer, HIV, and liver disease,” says Dr. Campbell. “If you are taking biotin and plan to have labs, definitely stop at least a week before your blood tests.” The only time biotin supplementation is recommended is when you are deficient, which can be determined through blood work. Dr. Campbell says getting tested for a biotin deficiency is really only necessary if “you are experiencing symptoms like rashes and neurologic issues in addition to hair loss and brittle nails.” But again, it’s super rare. Related Stories “It is not recommended to supplement biotin unless you are breastfeeding or pregnant. Pregnancy and smoking increase the metabolism (consumption by the body) of biotin, but supplementation in smokers isn’t recommended,” says Dr. Campbell, “There are rare cases of biotin deficiency that are genetic/inherited or acquired. You are born with the genetic cause or can develop a deficiency if you consume raw egg whites over a long period of time or suffer from alcoholism.” If you’re experiencing hair loss and don’t know why, both the derms recommend seeing a board-certified dermatologist to figure out the type of hair loss you are experiencing. “If it is determined by a doctor that you have a type of hair loss possibly associated with a vitamin deficiency or something that could be picked up on a lab and treated with supplement or medication, then it’s worth obtaining blood work,” says Dr. Campbell. “Usually, iron, zinc, and vitamin D are checked and supplemented if they are too low, and vitamin A can be checked if there is a concern for it being too high. Thyroid abnormalities can also be associated with hair loss and treated with oral medications like synthroid so this is often checked when appropriate.” If you’re experiencing brittle and dull hair rather than hair loss you can incorporate supplements that help to strengthen and condition the hair that you do have. Dr. Fromowitz is a fan of Nurafol and Viviscal. Nutrafol — $88.00 Available in separate formulas for women and men, Nutrafol works by giving your hair the nutrients it needs to thrive while also blocking DHT, or dihydrotestosterone, a hormone that can shorten the hair’s growth cycle and shrink its follicle.

        "content": "I BS and anal seem like they go together as well as retinol and sun exposure. After all, anal sex involves putting something in where poop comes out, and, untreated, IBS is a condition marked by, well, unexpected bouts of diarrhea. There are certainly things people with IBS should know beforehand, but it is fully possible for someone to have safe, pleasurable, mess-free, receptive anal sex with IBS . Ahead, anal sex experts (including a gastroenterologist) answer all your questions about how to make it as enjoyable as possible. First off: Is it safe to have anal sex with IBS? There isn’t a one-size-fits-all-asses answer. Why? Because IBS itself does not present the same amongst all people who have it, explains Daniel O’Shaughnessy, an award-winning nutritionist and author of Naked Nutrition , a guide about what to eat for mess-free anal. “Generally speaking, it is safe to have anal sex if you have IBS and your symptoms are under control,” says Elena A. Ivanina, DO, MPH Director of Neurogastroenterology and Motility with Lenox Hill Hospital. However, if someone is currently experiencing symptoms—such as pain, uncontrolled diarrhea, bloating, or abdominal cramping—then they should see a gastroenterologist to come up with a care plan for their condition before anal play, she says. Okay, but am I more likely to poop during anal if I have IBS? “No, you’re not necessarily more likely to poop during anal sex if you have IBS,” says general surgeon Evan Goldstein, DO, a doctor in New York City who specializes in anal care and the founder of Bespoke Surgical and Future Method. Related Stories Poop is not stored in the anal canal, it merely passes through it, he explains. It’s technically stored higher up in the body in a section of the large intestine called the rectum, which is separated from the anal canal with a muscle called the internal anal sphincter. Typically, Dr. Goldstein says, this muscle only releases to let poop pass through the canal after your brain has sent your body that “I have to poop” signal (you know the one!). So, unless you ignore the “TOILET NOW” message from your brain, the odds of you pooping during anal sex is very rare—and that stands for people with or without IBS. “If you have IBS you don’t need to be afraid of pooping during anal play unless you are experiencing a bout of IBS-related symptoms,” he says. In actuality, people with IBS may be less likely to make a mess during anal, according to Dr. Goldstein. “Many people with GI conditions are more in tune with their bodies than the average population, so they know what their body can and cannot handle,” he says. Hey, they don’t call it a gut instinct for nothing. Still, anal may not be for everyone with IBS because of pain Poop isn’t the only potential side effect of having anal sex with IBS. Sadly, there’s also the potential for pain. While there is a common misconception that anal sex is “supposed” to be painful, that’s actually not the case, says Dr. Goldstein. With adequate lubrication, pre-play, and anal training, receptive anal play should not be painful, he says. However, pain may not be avoidable for people with IBS for a few different reasons. It’s common for people with IBS to have uber-tight anal sphincter muscles, says Dr. Goldstein. (Medically this is known as concomitant pelvic floor dysfunction). “When people spend their day fearing that they’re going to need to use the bathroom or have an accident, they end up squeezing their pelvic floors (which includes their anal sphincter muscles) all day long,” he explains. This consistent clenching can leave your sphincter muscles in a state of constant-contraction, which makes your hole so small and tight that penetration is simply not possible (even with a beginner butt plug). Receptive anal sex can also be painful or uncomfortable if you’ve been going to the bathroom a lot, says Dr. Goldstein. “Going often can leave your hole sore, and in some instances chaffed from the toilet paper,” he says. If your stools were hard or especially hard to pass, it’s possible that you have collected microtears along the delicate anal tissues, he says. As you may have guessed, having papercut-like rips inside your anal canal can make anal sex feel very stingy, he says. Ouch! What about douching before having anal sex with IBS? ICYDK: An anal douche is a power wash for your anal canal. Anal douching involves pumping water (or a special solution) into the anal canal with a lightbulb-shaped bulb to rinse your rear clean of any lingering residue, explains Dr. Goldstein. This is a pre-sex step that can help boost confidence, he says, but it certainly isn’t necessary—even if you have IBS. If you do douche, however, Dr. Goldstein recommends doing so with something called an isotonic liquid solution (like the Future Method Disposable Rectal Wash), which just means a liquid that has the same pressure and composition as the liquid in your cells—the fluids in IVs, for example, are isotonic. Using plain water, he explains, can mess with your anal microbiome and increase your risk for microtears from either pooping or penetration. “You also don’t want to over-douche,” says Dr. Goldstein. “If you use too much liquid or rinse too many cycles, you risk causing yourself unwanted GI symptoms like bloating and gas, which mirror the symptoms of IBS.” So follow the instructions on your anal douche carefully. Exactly how to have anal sex with IBS 1. Talk to your doctor Before you consider having anal with IBS, talk to your healthcare provider, suggest O’Shaughnessy. If you’re already diagnosed with IBS, odds are you have a go-to gastroenterologist who has helped you come up with a management plan. So, ring ‘em up and ask them if it’s safe for you to have anal, given your crop of symptoms, he says. No need to be shy—trust, they’ve heard it all. 2. Eat mindfully As a general rule, what you eat when you have IBS is important. Well, it’s arguably even more important if you have IBS and are planning to enjoy receptive anal. You shouldn’t edit your diet without consulting your gastroenterologist, says O’Shaughnessy. But as a general rule, “you want to avoid consuming too much fat or too much caffeine ahead of anal play,” he says. Both can stimulate the gut and increase risk of unexpected and unwanted bowel movements. Adding fiber and probiotic supplements to your daily routine can also help reduce the chances of an accident during anal sex, notes Dr. Goldstein. “Fiber is helpful because it bulks your stool and encourages complete bowel emptying, while probiotics help encourage a healthier digestive system overall.” 3. Don’t douche…during anal masturbation “Most of us—even those of us with IBS—are actually ready at the drop of our pants to engage in anal sex, without having to do any douche to prepare,” says Dr. Goldstein. But if you’d like to have a trial run before testing out anal with a partner, not using a douche while you masturbate will allow you to see just how “ready” you actually are without a douche, he explains, adding that this should give you the confidence to have anal without douching first during any partnered play later on. 4. Boycott wet wipes Anal play in your future or not, Dr. Goldstein recommends staying away from wet wipes. Wiping with wet wipes, he explains, can mess with the anal microbiome, cause irritation, and bacterial infection. If you have IBS, these additional peach problems can make anal sex even less comfy. 5. Dilate If your sphincter is more uptight than Brett and Marshall in the latest season of Love Is Blind , anal dilation exercises may help. “Using anal dilators can help stretch the skin and muscle in the anal area, as well as train you to relax those muscles” says Dr. Goldstein. Together, this can make anal entry more comfortable. “The best part is the time commitment is nominal,” he says. “Just three to five minutes per session, two to three times a week is adequate to see major change.” You can even do it in the shower, which makes for easy clean-up! 6. Have a poop plan Despite your best efforts, there is always some chance shit will happen. So, if you’re going to have anal O’Shaughnessy says it’s best to expect the best but prepare for the worst. In practice, this looks like talking to your partner about the possibility ahead of play, keeping a towel within reach, and doing it on a blanket you don’t care about.

    "content": "The coronation of Britain's King Charles III was without doubt a spectacular event, but some invitees looked more the part than others - Euronews Culture takes a look While all eyes were firmly on Charles III and Camilla at the coronation of Britian's new king and queen, it's little surprise that some of the guests at the royal event of the year drew some attention. Among more than 2,200 invitees, has picked a few of the best dressed - and some that very much missed the mark... Many coronation viewers probably didn’t realise Conservative MP Penny Mordaunt would even play a role, but she was one of the most commented on aspects of the whole affair - and not least for her impressive outfit. In her role as Lord President of the Council, she was the first ever woman responsible for carrying out the ancient custom of bestowing King Charles with the 'Jewelled Sword of Offering'. Mordaunt wore a dress and cape designed by Safiyaa and a chunky headband from Jane Taylor, all embroidered by Hand and Lock with the golden fern motif of the Privy Council. Kate, Princess of Wales and her eight-year-old Princess Charlotte of Wales both wore beautifully embroidered Alexander McQueen outfits, featuring rose, thistle, daffodil and shamrock motifs, emblems signifying the four nations of the United Kingdom. Both also wore headpieces - rather than tiaras, paying heed to Charles’ wishes - crafted by milliner Jess Collett in conjunction with Alexander McQueen’s creative director Sarah Burton. The late Queen Elizabeth II’s second cousin Lady Helen Taylor wowed in a Dior ensemble, inspired by the French fashion house’s famed ‘new look’. Lady Sarah Chatto, the only daughter of the late Princess Margaret and the cousin of King Charles III, wore an elegant cream ensemble and accessorised with a triple strand pearl necklace - a royal signature. Finnegan Biden, granddaughter of the US president Joe, wore a yellow silk crepe dress and cape from American designer Markarian Sommer seamed with a matching headband, as she accompanied her grandmother Jill to the event. Together, the pair looked rather like the Ukrainian flag although it's unclear whether this was an intentional choice. Among the best dressed royals was Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, who wore a bespoke dress from, appropriately, Dutch designer Jan Taminiau. Pavlos, the Crown Prince of Greece became head of the Greek royal family following his father's death in January this year and lead the best dressed men at Charles' coronation in his smart three piece suit and medals. Queen Letizia of Spain, accompanied her dashing husband King Felipe VI, wearing a pink suit and matching ‘Scala Insignia’ clutch, designed especially for her by Carolina Herrera's Creative Director, Wes Gordon. Queen Jetsun Pema of Bhutan looked elegant in a version of her country's national costume, wearing a beautiful printed lavender two piece. Princess Anne’s daughter Zara Tindall stood out in a bright blue coat dress by Laura Green, teamed with coordinating hat and shoes. Charles’ niece also wore a diamond brooch which had been a gift from the King to Princess Anne on her wedding day. Representing British fashion, British Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful wore a bespoke morning suit by Savile Row tailors Huntsman, looking dapper in a pale blue waistcoat, navy spotted tie, black overcoat and grey striped trousers. While most guests looked good - or at least appropriate - U.S. pop star Katy Perry, who will be performing at , demonstrated what happens when an American tries a little too hard to fit in at a very British event. Her lilac outfit complete with opera gloves and giant hat stood out for the wrong reasons - but her Vivienne Westwood necklace was a nice nod to British design. Boris Johnson and his wife Carrie were among the worst dressed on the day, with the former British Prime Minister looking scruffy, as always. Carrie’s attempts to look smart looked too 1980s and she wore too many shades of blue in one outfit - a style fail for both members of this political couple. By a country kilometre, the worst dressed at the coronation was Conservative MP Therese Coffey. Her Union Jack print scarf was the cherry on top of a truly terrible outfit, flying the flag far too literally.

    "description": "The founder of a famous Glasgow restaurant has talked about his decision to sell it",
    "content": "THE founder of a famous Glasgow restaurant which brought a historic landmark building back to life has reflected on his decision to sell the business and on the highs and lows of his 50 years in the hospitality sector in Scotland. Marco Giannasi told The Herald in an exclusive interview last week that he had “no regrets” over his decision to sell the Battlefield Rest business. He sold the Battlefield Rest as a going concern to long-serving staff member Alex Matheson and wife Jen Doherty last December, having founded the bustling restaurant in 1994. The sale was not announced publicly at the time, with Mr Giannasi noting regulars had learned of the deal by word of mouth over recent months. Mr Giannasi noted that it was on March 24, 1973, that he had first become involved in the hospitality sector in Glasgow, at the age of 18. He emphasised that this move had been unexpected, given he was studying architecture and design in the Italian city of Lucca and had a master of arts qualification. His move followed the death of his father, Luigi, on March 4 that year. READ MORE: Ian McConnell: Will SNP deliver, as Tories refuse to fix mess? Commenting on his move to Scotland to take over the running of L’ariosto on Mitchell Street, Mr Giannasi said: “It was really a shock to the system because I wasn’t planning to be in this industry in the first place.” The Battlefield Rest opened on October 22, 1994. The restaurant notes on its website that its premises, dating back to 1914, were “originally used as a resting and courting place for tram travellers”. Mr Giannasi highlighted his wish to sell the Battlefield Rest to a member of staff to avoid the “traumatic” scenario of an entirely new operator coming in. He highlighted the fact that the building had been at risk of demolition before he succeeded in acquiring it. He launched the Battlefield Rest with Joe Moretti, who Mr Giannasi noted had retired from the business about 16 years ago. The restaurant was owned by Mr Giannasi and his wife at the time of its sale last December. Mr Giannasi highlighted the prospect of acquiring the building for the Battlefield Rest as the high point of his 50 years in the hospitality sector. He said: “The high point was obviously when I realised I could purchase the building. That was what really attracted me. My background was old buildings and [an] interest in design. READ MORE: Ian McConnell: Surely ‘idiocy’ characterisation will embarrass brass-necked Brexiters “It was such an excitement when I realised I could actually purchase the building I’d been passing [for] four-and-a-half years before and was getting increasingly dilapidated. Every day, it was getting worse and worse and worse.” Mr Giannasi, who bought the building around the middle of 1992, said: “It took [about] two years to get it back to the way it was.” Reflecting on his decision to sell the Battlefield Rest, he said: “It is good times for me. It was the right time for me. I feel good about it. I am positive about my decision and, looking back, I have no regrets. It was for a good reason.” He and wife Yellena continue to own the historic building which is home to the Battlefield Rest and are now the landlords of the business, which employs 22 people. Mr Giannasi continues to work at the restaurant for four half-days each week. READ MORE: Denial after denial from brass-necked Tory arch-Brexiter On whether the working dynamic for him at the Battlefield Rest was much as it was previously, Mr Giannasi said: “Alex has got a very good nature. I think we are working together so far as a team. We are really [like] father and son – that type of relationship. We slag each other, we joke. I call him ‘mini-me’.” Asked about his decision to sell, Mr Giannasi said: “Before lockdown, I was contemplating making the next move, how to do it He added that, after he had eventually made his decision to sell, the deal had taken a bit more than a year to conclude. Mr Giannasi, who noted Mr Matheson had worked at the Battlefield Rest for about nine years, said: “I offered the opportunity for any member of staff to come forward and [said] if you are interested in taking the business, this is the opportunity. Otherwise the next step was to go public and to get a completely new operator to take over and [that] would have been much more traumatic for ourselves, myself, and the staff. “A few months later, Alex…came back with some offer.” Mr Giannasi’s father opened the first Italian restaurant in Glasgow in the late-1950s, Canasta in Parliamentary Road. Amid redevelopment, he had then relocated to Mitchell Street in the early-1970s, where he took over premises and founded L’ariosto, undertaking a major redevelopment and ordering furniture from Italy. Mr Giannasi noted his father had also had a keen interest in art and design. Asked about the highs and lows of his 50 years in the hospitality sector, Mr Giannasi said of the L’ariosto move: “The low was obviously stepping into a massive 140-seat restaurant with about 36 members of staff [who] I had never met before [and were] much more mature than me and trying to get into this new world for us and for my mother especially. “It was a learning process for us and [it took] a few years for us to try and find our way around.” Noting it was a “different type of restaurant”, he added: “It was an eye-opener for us. The low point was trying to equalise my father’s experience and talent, which was impossible.” Mr Giannasi said that, after moving to Glasgow from Italy in 1973, he had run L’ariosto with his mother, Leda, for about eight years, before deciding to sell the restaurant for personal reasons. He then went on to restore the Pirn Inn at Balfron and ran it for about seven years, before opening Toscana in Milngavie. Mr Giannasi also operated a catering unit at the Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988. Asked about the funniest moments during his 50 years in the hospitality sector, Mr Giannasi recalled the opening day of the Battlefield Rest. He said: “On the first day when we first opened, the full shelf of crockery in the kitchen, [with] the plates, collapsed. There was such an impact of noise – at least 100 plates – the shelf collapsed from the wall. “It was like a bottle of champagne when you crack on the boat – we just had 100 plates smash to the floor.”",

    "content": "For my son's seventh birthday party - when the pressure was on to come up with something different from his friends' celebrations that year - we had a day out somewhere or other but then came back home for sleepover in the back garden. There was a big tent for the boys (small pop-up one for me), snacks-a-plenty, and the icing on the birthday cake was a film under the stars courtesy of my laptop and a projector borrowed from work. The kids loved it, settling back, cans of Coke and crisps in hand, watching The Simpsons Movie at a size a bedsheet attached to the hedge would allow. Sound wasn't great, but I attached some powered speakers to the laptop's headphone socket and we just about heard it over the excited chatter. Advertisement Advertisement Roll forward 13 or so years and projectors have come a long way since then, but the excitement of using one remains the same. I was asked to test the recently-launched N1 Projector by Emotn, a sub-brand of Chinese company Dangbei, a premium provider of smart large-screen services and a specialist in designing and developing software matrix, operating systems, smart projectors and more. Advertisement Advertisement Being a Netflix Officially-Licensed projector the N1 has access to the Netflix library at the press of a button, delivering a theatre-like audio-visual experience with Dolby Audio through dual 5W speakers and a large projection size of up to 120 inches. Amazon and YouTube apps are also built-in, and also the option of playing your own stuff - but more of that later. Inside the box is the N1 itself, a power cord, transformer and a remote control and a small start-up manual. The manual is brief - the main instructions for set-up appearing on screen. Advertisement Advertisement And this is where I went wrong, at least to start with, so I recommend this preparation. I'd hoped to confine my testing to a small area, the back of a white dinner tray being my projector screen. However, the autofocus would simply not work at such a short distance, so my advice is to set up a decent-sized screen first, or a suitably light-coloured wall, as otherwise instructions to connect to the wifi can't be read clearly enough. Advertisement Advertisement One handy feature on the remote is the autofocus button - hold for a few seconds and the N1 focuses itself perfectly for you to proceed. Connecting to the wifi is straightforward, with a computer keyboard appearing on screen with which to plough through via the remote. Once connected, subscription details to Netflix and Amazon (if you have them) can be input in the same way. YouTube can be set up too so have your required Google password and username details handy. The remote control features hotkeys for these three main video services allowing consumers to access their go-to apps with a single press. Advertisement Advertisement The N1 has built-in Dolby Audio and dual 5W speakers which are more than adequate for sound purposes, but I was able to connect to my powerful Bluetooth speaker via the home page for an even more enhanced audio experience. Your headphones or earbuds can be connected the same way for solo viewing and there's also an output jack for wired audio connection. So what else can be connected for viewing? From the top of the home page there are three connection options - HDMI and USB, the ports of which are at the rear of the N1, and the home screen itself with the built in apps, meaning that all manner of devices can be connected, like USB dongles and sticks such as NOW TV and Roku, laptops, settop boxes like Sky and Virgin, and memory sticks or hard drives with your own movies can be connected. And obviously joystick-wielders can enhance their gaming experience too in high 1080p full DH definition via the HDMI cable. Advertisement Advertisement You can also wirelessly mirror your mobile using your phone's Cast tool settings. Seconds later a mirror image of your phone appears on the projector screen, and I was then able to watch a home video stored on my phone and then cast a BBC Sport app game of snooker to the N1 - but be aware that apps like Virgin Go and Sky Sports will not allow wireless streaming from your phone. For this a wired connection from your settop box or laptop would be required. The Emotn N1 has 1080P full HD clarity, 500 ANSI Lumens and a maximum projection size of 120 inches, Laser Autofocus and Auto Keystone Correction, to free the user's hands to a great extent. The ToF Laser Autofocus prevents the projected images from staying blurry for more than a few seconds, and the entire focusing process is nearly seamless to the users. With the Auto Keystone Correction, viewers can always get a clear rectangular picture even if the N1 is set slightly to one side rather than the usual head-on position. The built-in stand on the bottom enables viewers to adjust the angle of projection in a breeze by up to 12 degrees, and there's a standard 1/4\" screw for tripod use. Advertisement Advertisement The Emotn N1 is also long-lasting with its large 30,000-hour lifespan, and a 26dB noise level makes it a quite quiet companion at the same time. Remember, this is still a projector and not a TV screen, so relative darkness is still required for optimum viewing quality, as is ample space, so the N1 might not be something you can use all of the time. But when you do it makes for a fantastic friends and family experience. The N1 is available from Amazon priced £399. Advertisement Advertisement WHAT'S IN THE BOX?

    "content": "The Coronation Concert will celebrate the crowning of King Charles and Queen Camilla and will take place on Sunday 7 May - the day after the coronation at Westminster Abbey. Here's who's on the line-up... The reign of King Charles and Queen Camilla begins in earnest on Sunday with street parties across the UK and an enormous serving of musical nostalgia in prospect at the Coronation Concert at Windsor Castle. Take That, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie are among musical acts on the line-up for Sunday night's event, hosted by the BBC, which will take place in front of an audience of 20,000 members of the public. The concert will also include performances by Italian opera star, Andrea Bocelli; Welsh bass-baritone Sir Bryn Terfel; singer-songwriter Freya Ridings and classical-soul composer, Alexis Ffrench. Take That's performance will feature three of the original members - Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald. In a joint statement, they said they \"couldn't wait\" for the show. \"This will be our first live show since the Odyssey Tour, four years ago in 2019, and what a stage to come back on.” Katy Perry said she was \"excited\" to perform as well as \"shine a light further\" on The British Asian Trust, a charity founded by the King when he was the Prince of Wales. The charity - of which Perry is an ambassador - works to tackle widespread poverty and hardship in South Asia, as well as raise funds to end child trafficking. It is widely reported, however, that a number of performers have refused invitations to appear including Adele, the Spice Girls, Ed Sheeran, Sir Elton John and Harry Styles. Other stars such as US actor Tom Cruise and British veteran actress Joan Collins have recorded video messages. However the stage will be set for a coronation choir made up of amateur singers from across the UK, including refugee choirs, NHS choirs, LGBTQ+ singing groups and deaf signing choirs. This choir will appear alongside a virtual choir, made up of singers from across the Commonwealth. A massive light display will form the centrepiece of the concert. Locations across the UK will be lit up using projections, lasers, drone displays and illuminations. Quite how many people will tune in remains to be determined, recent pre-coronation in the coronation. In a YouGov poll last month of more than 3,000 adults, 35% said they “did not care very much” about the event, and 29% said they did not care at all. 24% of people said they cared “a fair amount” and only 9% said they cared “a great deal”. However, 46% said they were likely to take part in related coronation celebrations. Additional sources Share this article",

    "description": "What to watch on UK TV: Queer Eye; Salinger; Mad Women - Alison Rowat's picks of the week",
    "content": "The job involved hiding in the bushes, camping out for days wondering if you were ever going to get a sniff of the subject. It was like photographing wildlife, says one of the doughty, only the “quarry” was JD Salinger, a reclusive writer of a cult novel that spoke to millions and continues to do so to this day. Director Shane Salerno had his own Herculean task when making the documentary Salinger (Sky Arts , Tuesday, 9pm). Yet from a mountain of interviews with the author’s friends, acquaintances and biographers, plus acres of footage and other material, some of it previously unseen, he manages to assemble a compelling portrait of a man who famously did not want to be known. Some of the sharpest observations come from those who knew Salinger in the days before The Catcher in the Rye, when he was just another struggling writer being rejected by The New Yorker magazine. Except he wasn’t struggling. Salinger lived with his parents in a Park Avenue apartment. He had been to all the best schools and been kicked out of them, much like his anti-hero, Holden Caulfield. The part about being rejected by The New Yorker was true, though he was hardly alone in that. Love TV? Subscribe now for a pick of the week's best programmes He finally had a short story about Holden accepted, but the Second World War saw it shelved. Salinger fought in Europe, continuing to work on Catcher whenever he could. Legend has it he had pages on him when he landed on the beaches of Normandy. War made Salinger the writer he became, but it broke him too. What he had seen in combat, and the camps, led to a breakdown, a fate some of his best-known characters would share. Catcher eventually made its debut in 1951 and would go on to sell in the tens of millions. One teenager’s cry of anguish against phoneys was heard around the world and it still sells in six figures to this day. Other writers would make the most of the adulation that followed, but not Salinger. He took himself to a cabin in the woods of New Hampshire, never to be seen or heard from again. Or so went the legend. As Salerno shows, he did engage with the outside world when he wanted. At this point the documentary takes a turn for the bleak. Salinger may have been a hero on the page, but in reality he was a flawed individual who allowed nothing to interfere with his work. Salerno’s documentary comes in a movie-length two hours and 40 minutes. Slick editing makes it rattle along but at times it looks its age. The real pity is that it was released in 2013 and more has happened since in the Salinger story. The essentials are here though, making this a must-see for anyone who will forever hold a torch for Holden. READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon on Loose Women It has been 16 years, can you believe, since Mad Men shimmied on to television to sell viewers an initially seductive view of the advertising industry. The male Madison Avenue execs had a high old time of it, but what of the women, the Peggy Olsens stuck in the typing pool? Some of Peggy’s British counterparts are interviewed in Mad Women (Channel 4, Tuesday, 10pm). When they started their careers, women were portrayed in advertising in two ways - they were either obsessed with keeping a clean house, or getting and keeping a man. The idea of women making ads that went beyond sexist stereotypes was just too far out to be believable. Then along came a certain jeans ad set in a launderette and started a mini-revolution. Barbara Nokes got the idea for the Levi 501 ad from her own life. She really was sitting in a launderette one evening when a man came in, stripped to his underwear, and bundled his clothes into a machine. In the ad, the guy became Nick Kamen, the soundtrack was Marvin Gaye, and the rest was … well, you know the punchline. We also meet the female execs behind boundary-pushing ads for Flake, Diet Coke, Lynx, Dove and other brands. Although you have to remind yourself at times that they are talking about selling stuff and not saving the world, the women here undoubtedly changed the industry and helped change the culture along the way. READ MORE: Blood Money and World's Most Secret Hotels It has been so long since the chaps of Queer Eye (Netflix) were around I had begun to think they had gone their separate ways. Never fear: the original, and some would say still the best, of the life makeover programmes, Queer Eye is back for a seventh series. It’s still the same “Fab Five” line-up giving advice on interior design, fashion , grooming, and so on - but the location has moved from Texas to New Orleans, a city still haunted by the Hurricane Katrina disaster. Queer Eye can sometimes be cheesier than the world’s biggest toastie, but the hearts of all concerned are in the right place. Their dancing is pretty dang fine too.",

    "content": "German bespoke sports car producer, Wiesmann, has unveiled Project Thunderball, a limited edition of three car design concepts in partnership with German design company studiocurbos. The craftsmanship of luxury sportscar making is unique unto itself and the Germans are arguably the top of the list when it comes to producing the best sports cars. Known for their innovation, reliability, and overall build quality, the Germans have proved they know what they’re doing when it comes to making supercars. Wiesmann, a German bespoke sports car producer, is now hoping to enhance that reputation and put some distance between themselves and their Italian counterparts. The firm has recently unveiled Project Thunderball, a limited edition of three car design concepts in partnership with German design company studiocurbos. Although headquartered in Dülmen, Germany, CEO Roheen Berry; who has been at the helm of the creative process of this project, is keen to make a bespoke luxury dent in markets beyond Europe. Their innovations are completely sold out at the moment. Europe has always been their traditional market with the UK market getting bigger. The company has had record sales in the US, with a lot of interest in the Middle East with strong interest of orders in the UAE. But countries like Vietnam are ordering, with a following in Japan and China Berry’s time at Harvard led him to work for Contec Global and then to Wiesmann, but Contec prepared him in more ways than one to be a CEO. At Contec he was in the high security tech space. “Everybody told me then, ‘no, you can't do this, it's a place for governments.’ But we did it very successfully and still do it. After that we moved into the online banking sector and it was very successful. Contec allowed me to go into places and give me the skillset to manage large companies, and do things that people always said I couldn’t. And at the same time that allowed me also to have a very international spread, which I think a car company requires. It's an electric car now so the tech angle really helps. I believe in the product and in what we've made and I'd like to think that I had a big role in that.” Berry’s family acquired Wiesmann in 2016 with the aim of continuing the pioneering vision of the founding brothers, Martin and Friedhelm who aimed to create bespoke sports cars that defy the norm. “One of the things about the car is that it's very, very classic looking,” says Berry. \"And when we were designing it, we wanted to continue with the typical Wiesmann design, bringing it into the future, but at the same time have that classic look to it. Some of the old cars were designed in the early 2000s and they still look relevant.” “The other thing about investment is I've always used the comparison of Bruce Wayne and Batman. If you have a half of a Wiesmann painted in, let's call it like British Racing Green, with a tan interior, you have Bruce Wayne. But, on the other side you have a dark matte black color, then you have Batman. So just by changing the colors you can completely change the look and feel of the car and that appeals to a different audience,” he explains. This Bruce Wayne versus Batman style caters to differing audiences. The dark black matte will cater to a younger crowd, while the wood carbon mixture of blue and cream interior will appeal more an older audience, the Riviera South of France set. Berry got acquainted with Wiesmann by becoming a customer first. After buying a car he was drawn to the quality and bespoke aspect of the brand. So, getting involved in the design of the cars is one of his top priorities. “Right from the first design I have been pretty much involved in every single piece of it. A lot of it has been in my head. I'm quite visual that way and I generally tend to think of things or they pop into my brain and then and then I apply them,\" Berry explains. \"We were very lucky to have studiocurbos for both. They’re essential because you have to have a very good, capable professional design team to simply get through most of the crash requirements, crumple tests, sight of line tests, and of course aerodynamics. So yeah, I was involved in every single part and the three different concepts are pretty much a team idea but again, definitely stem from me,\" he adds. The three concepts are original and specific to those they’re tailored to. Concept one is likened to the dreamy blue waters of Cote d’Azur. The ocean blue metallic paint is bespoke and matches with the orange leather interior and cream canvas accents that makes you feel you're on a Saint Tropez beach. “I think this concept is probably the most elegant one. I can see a famous movie star driving down to the French Riviera and a beautiful yacht park beside it,” he says. Concept two is inspired by the 1920s, particularly the Gatsby era of excess and vibrant parties. With its bold green exterior contrasted with its deep burgundy leather interior and matte velvet details it succeeds in being both suave and debonair. “The Gatsby is for a more flamboyant customer, who is a little bit showier. “There's a large demand in that segment,” Berry notes. And the third concept is described by the company as being “like a stealth shadow across the sky.” Its black matte finish makes it stand out. It’s inspired by the dark night and heroes of darkness. The black leather interiors with anodized detailing and gloss carbon fibre catches the eye. “It’s black on black, on black on black,” muses Berry, “and it looks mean and aggressive. That's my car for sure,” he laughs.” It will take about three to four months to fill each order. As soon as customers make their choices the faster the company can produce their car. Because the concept cars are electric they are made quicker than gasoline cars, because those have to be hand-built. And it also helps that the Wiesmann production lines are more efficient. The cars have a three to four-year warranty on them. If there are mechanical issues, either a Wiesmann partner can fix the issue, otherwise the car has to be sent to their facility in Germany. In places where they have large sales of replacement cars, customers can use that until their car is ready. Just as someone can go to Savile Row and get a bespoke suit made, someone can go to Wiesman and get a bespoke car made. This is an essential aspect for the car market and Berry explains why. “This is a very individual product. It's a very special looking vehicle. It's timeless. We always want to give our customers a positive feeling. All Wiesmann’s when you drive one out, you would make 30,000 Euros on them, so now we've priced the car below what a second hand Wiesmann goes for now. A lot is going to be dependent on the way things go. You're going to have to buy or get into an electric vehicle simply because you know the younger generation is not going to take these big V8s or V10s or V12s anymore. If you want to lead by example, be individual, be bespoke, enjoy your vehicle, and also make a profit then Wiesmann is the go-to.\" While traditionally men are more likely to buy a sports car from brands like Ferrari or Porsche for their own use, Wiesmann are noticing a trend where couples are buying their cars to enjoy weekend trips together. The cars have enough space in both the front and back trunks to accommodate luggage for both individuals. Furthermore, there is a growing trend of women buyers in the luxury sports car market. This year’s Salon Privé in London saw a lot of women approaching the brand showing interest in purchasing. Berry’s answer to this is simple: “Women are, I think, the highest growing segment for the luxury market for sports cars. This one is very much like a mixed bag in the sense it's very well made. You can bespoke it. The colours are very interesting, the design is elegant and it brings some kind of romantic thought process with its design. Women are drawn to the car, we see that now. At Salon Privé with the amount of people, women were very much interested. And we've also seen the orders that have been reflected which are women.” “We take care of things like your line of sight, so it's actually safer for the pedestrian or other drivers and you feel better driving through spaces as well.” And Berry and his team of engineers and designers have made sure the company’s bespoke services go so far as to benefit women customers. “If you look at the old cars they had a very high ledge, which made it uncomfortable for women getting in or getting out, which stopped a lot of customers from buying them. So, we made huge efforts in the new seats to make sure that it drops and it allows a lady to get in or out of a car elegantly and hopefully, you know, they appreciate this.” Video editor Share this article",

    "content": "Miscarriage is a common struggle for many women but the emotions and turmoil it can create are too often overlooked or ignored. This French illustrator uses her drawings to shed light on the issue. At least one in ten women around the world will miscarry in her lifetime, which means nearly everyone on the planet likely knows someone who has had a miscarriage. Why, then, are we so bad at talking about them? French illustrator Mathilde Lemiesle has made it her mission to break the taboo through her comic strips, which she’s turned into a book called “_My Almost Nothings_”. On her Instagram of the same name, she gathers testimonies from women, thoughts and studies and transforms them into emotional and educational drawings addressing miscarriage, feminism and women’s rights. “What surprised me most at the start of My Almost Nothings is realising that I wasn’t alone,” Lemiesle told Euronews Culture. “That was a real revelation for me, especially because we had all experienced the same things, the same pains. That was very important for what the account became and for my own activism.” At the heart of Lemiesle’s fight is her own personal story. She experienced four miscarriages before giving birth to her daughter, and said she felt isolated and ill-informed about what was happening inside her body. Drawing is what helped her get her feelings out onto paper, and ultimately heal. Now she hopes to offer other women the same respite, giving them a space to share their experiences while also informing them of the more nitty gritty aspects of miscarriage. “The fact that women are ill-informed puts them in situations that can be dangerous,” she says. “For example, we’re often told that it’s like a heavy period, when that’s not at all the case. It’s yet another way to minimise what they’re going through and it’s just unacceptable.” Some of the common cultural norms that Lemiesle takes issue with: The fact that women are told to keep their pregnancies private until their foetus is 12 weeks old, after which the probability of a miscarriage is lower. That doctors tell them a miscarriage “feels like a heavy period.” That friends and family, who struggle to find the words, often brush a miscarriage off as nothing to worry about. Even the term miscarriage is problematic, according to Lemiesle. In French, a miscarriage translates to “fausse couche” or “false birth”. Lemiesle says this puts the blame squarely on women for failing to carry the pregnancy to term. She advocates instead for the more neutral term “grossesse arrêtée” or “stopped pregnancy” to be used. “The term false birth isn’t correct if you ask me, because there’s nothing false about it,” she said. “It devalues what the woman is experiencing, it trivialises it and minimises it.” A similar debate in the English-speaking world suggests “pregnancy loss” should be used instead of “miscarriage,” which implies the woman has made a “mistake”. Speaking freely about pregnancy loss is the first step towards normalising it in society, and Lemiesle says she’s noticed more and more people are coming forward with their own stories of miscarriage. “It’s increasingly talked about, by celebrities who tell their own personal stories, but also I think in tighter, more intimate circles of women,” she said. “All of this is bringing the issue into the public and political spheres, because it affects a lot of women.” In France, 200,000 miscarriages occur every year - representing around one in four pregnancies. In March, the National Assembly unanimously approved a new draft law to give women more support in the event of a miscarriage. The bill, which goes before the Senate this week and is expected to pass into law, offers women paid leave from work in the event of a miscarriage. It also gives them access to mental health services covered by social security. “I think it’s a very good step towards something,” Lemiesle said. “It makes the issue known and shows that it’s an issue, that it’s not nothing. (Pregnancy loss) exists and it has both an emotional and physical impact. But we need to go even further.” Share this article",

The way you cook your liver can make a difference in how it tastes.

    "content": "In the run up to his coronation, King Charles' comments from the 1990s about the sovereign's role in supporting diverse faiths came under scrutiny. Now, many will be eager to see if he practices what he preached. Long before he became the sovereign, King Charles III spoke about creating a “modern monarchy”. Since Queen Elizabeth II’s death on 8 September 2022, Charles has reiterated that idea with talk of slimming down the monarchy by removing superfluous members from the royal payroll. Beyond that, one of the most significant changes Charles has presided over is to the Crown’s relationship with religion. Ever since King James IV of Scotland was proclaimed “Protector and Defender of the Christian Faith” by Pope Julius II in 1507, British monarchs have taken the title “Defender of the Faith” in differing forms, all of which after Henry VIII as the head of the Anglican Church. For hundreds of years, this has gone on undisturbed. England has been majority Anglican since Henry VIII, going some way to justify the title. However, for much of the British Empire, the number of Hindus and Muslims under British rule would far outnumber that of Protestants. Today, Britain is a far different picture. Last year, that in England and Wales, Christianity was still the largest single religious group, but - for the first time - was no longer the faith of the majority of the population, at 46.2 per cent of the population. That figure was 71.8 per cent 20 years prior. Part of the reason for the reduction in Christianity in the UK is down to an increased diversity of religions with more Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs in the country. That increase pales though in comparison to the increased number of people identifying with no religion. Suffice to say, the religious picture of the country Charles is inheriting is vastly different to the one his mother did. The principal leader of the , the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby play a central role in the Charles' coronation, however other non-Anglican Christian leaders also had prominent parts to play in the ceremony, as well as non-Christian religious leaders. Into her later years, Elizabeth II maintained the importance of her personal Anglican faith to her life. In contrast, Charles has a long history of a broader approach to his religious interests. Charles first suggested that he should be the “defender of faith” as opposed to the “Defender of Faith” in 1994, stirring controversy. Charles later noted that he had not intended to imply that his mother’s approach was as a defender to the exclusion of other faiths. In 2012, the Queen herself said: “The concept of our established Church is occasionally misunderstood and, I believe, commonly under-appreciated. Its role is not to defend Anglicanism to the exclusion of other religions. Instead, the Church has a duty to protect the free practice of all faiths in this country.” Although Charles has spoken on multiple occasions to clarify what he meant by his “defender of faith” comments, any question of whether he would make the alteration to the title was put aside during his accession. Making his oath to the Church of Scotland, he said the following: “I, Charles III, by the grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of my other realms and territories, King, , do faithfully promise and swear that I should inviolably maintain and preserve the settlement of the true Protestant religion as established by the laws made in Scotland in prosecution of the Claim of Right and particularly by an act intituled an act for securing the Protestant religion and Presbyterian church government and by the acts passed in the Parliament of both kingdoms for union of the two kingdoms, together with the government, worship, discipline, rights and privileges, of the Church of Scotland.” At a meeting of faith leaders shortly after his mother’s death and his accession to the throne, more specifically of his approach to protecting faith in the UK. “I have always thought of Britain as a ‘community of communities.’ That has led me to understand that the Sovereign has an additional duty – less formally recognized but to be no less diligently discharged. It is the duty to protect the diversity of our country, including by protecting the space for Faith itself and its practise through the religions, cultures, traditions and beliefs to which our hearts and minds direct us as individuals,” Charles said. “This diversity is not just enshrined in the laws of our country, it is enjoined by my own faith. As a member of the Church of England, my Christian beliefs have love at their very heart. By my most profound convictions, therefore – as well as by my position as Sovereign – I hold myself bound to respect those who follow other spiritual paths, as well as those who seek to live their lives in accordance with secular ideals.” He finished with a dedication to his mother. “This conviction was the foundation of everything my beloved mother did for our country, over her years as our Queen. It has been the foundation of my own work as Prince of Wales. It will continue to be the foundation of all my work as King.” Share this article",
