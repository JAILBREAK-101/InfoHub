"Barca's financial struggles are well-documented, with the club having already openly admitted they need to find solutions to satisfy LaLiga's financial fair play regulations, which currently prohibits them from making any signings in the next window. It is believed that one of the team's main priorities right now is Lionel Messi's potential return to the Camp Nou, but that deal would be highly dependent on player sales and a serious reduction of their wage bill. This has prompted the Catalan outfit to ask their squad to accept a 15% salary cut, although this was not universally accepted, with at least . With a busy off-season thus anticipated in Catalonia in the coming months, the Blaugrana appear to have ramped up their efforts to balance their books, having now put a steep price tag on one of their assets."

"Cape Town — The Proteas ’ ICC World Cup fate may be known on Tuesday when Ireland take on Bangladesh in the first of three ODI’s at Chelmsford, Essex. The Proteas are currently in eighth place on the ICC Super League table with 98 points from 21 matches but Rob Walters’ team have already completed their full quota of fixtures. The Proteas forfeited three ODI’s against Australia — and subsequently the opportunity to gain valuable Super League points — for Cricket SA to launch the inaugural Betway SA20 back in January. This has placed the Proteas’ chances of automatic qualification for the World Cup in India later this year in jeopardy as it has left Ireland with the opportunity to overtake South Africa in the ICC Super League should they complete 3-0 whitewash of Bangladesh. Ireland currently have 68 points and can potentially equal the Proteas’ 98 points, although South Africa currently have a superior net run-rate. Only the top eight teams qualify automatically for India, while the remainder will contest a qualifying tournament in Zimbabwe during June and July. Just like the Proteas did in their final series by holding back their Indian Premier League stars for the final series against the Netherlands, the Irish have bolstered their squad by recalling seamer Josh Little from the IPL. The left-arm seamer, who is the first Irishman to play in the IPL, has starred for the defending champions Gujarat Titans and also showed his class for the Pretoria Capitals in the Betway SA20. The Irish will hope Little can replicate his form from out the outset as any slip-up on Tuesday against Bangladesh, who are in fourth place and have already qualified, will ensure the Proteas’ automatic progression to the World Cup. @ ZaahierAdams IOL Sport Share"

"A stunning new report by Spanish broadcaster has claimed that Messi is set to accept an offer to play for Saudi Arabian giants Al Hilal. Things quickly boiled over between the player and his current employers Paris Saint-Germain after he made an unauthorised trip to the aforementioned country last week, missing training last Monday as a result. Having been slapped with a two-week unpaid suspension thereafter, , explaining that his visit to the Middle East nation, for whom he is a tourism ambassador, had long been planned and that he thought there would be no training on the day of his trip. Reports have since suggested that the Parisians have had a change of heart about allowing him to leave for free at the end of the season following his recorded apology, and are now once again open to renewing his deal at the Parc des Princes. However, Messi is now said to have decided to move on from the Ligue 1 club at the end of June, and his next destination appears to have been decided as well. According to , he will sign for Saudi powerhouses Al Hilal in a deal worth a soaring £400 million (R9.2 billion) a season. It is further claimed that FC Barcelona captain Sergio Busquets will also accept a two-season offer from the Arab team, while another Spanish veteran, Jordi Alba, could also sign for Al Hilal if he agrees to terminate his Blaugrana contract, with reports in Spain suggesting he will be approached to take yet another pay cut by the LaLiga club."
